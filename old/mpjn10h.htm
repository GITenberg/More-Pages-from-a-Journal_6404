<h2>A BAD DREAM</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Miss Toller, a lady about forty years old, kept a boarding-house,
called Russell House, at Brighton, in a dull but genteel part of the
town - so dull that even those fortunate inhabitants who were reputed
to have resources in themselves were relieved by a walk to the shops
or by a German band.&nbsp; Miss Toller could not afford to be nearer
the front.&nbsp; Rents were too high for her, even in the next street,
which claimed a sea-view sideways through the bow-windows.&nbsp; She
was the daughter of a farmer in Northamptonshire, and till she came
to Brighton had lived at home.&nbsp; When she was five-and-twenty her
mother died, and in two years her father married again.&nbsp; The second
wife was a widow, good-looking but hard, and had a temper.&nbsp; She
made herself very disagreeable to Miss Toller, and the husband took
the wife&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; Miss Toller therefore left the farm at
Barton Sluice, and with a little money that belonged to her purchased
the goodwill and furniture of Russell House.&nbsp; She brought with
her a Northamptonshire girl as servant, and the two shared the work
between them.&nbsp; At the time when this history begins she had five
lodgers, all of whom had been with her six months, and one for more
than a year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Poulter, the senior in residence of the five, was the widow
of a retired paymaster in the Navy.&nbsp; She was between fifty and
sixty, a big, portly woman.&nbsp; After her husband was pensioned she
lived in Southsea.&nbsp; As he belonged to the civilian branch, Mrs.
Poulter had to fight undauntedly in order to maintain a calling acquaintance
with the wives of executive officers, and in fact the highest she had
on her list was a commander&rsquo;s lady.&nbsp; When Paymaster Poulter
died, and his pension ceased, she gave up the struggle.&nbsp; She had
no children, and moved to Brighton with an annuity of &pound;150 a year
derived from her husband&rsquo;s insurance of &pound;2000, and a life
interest in some property left by her mother.</p>
<p>Mr. Goacher was a bachelor clergyman of about forty.&nbsp; He read
prayers, presided over the book-club, and by a judicious expenditure
of oil prevented friction between the other boarders.&nbsp; It was understood
that he had been compelled to give up clerical duty by what is called
clergyman&rsquo;s sore-throat.&nbsp; It was not known whether he had
been vicar, rector, or curate, but he wore the usual white neck-band
and a soft, low felt hat, he was clean-shaven, his letters were addressed
&lsquo;Reverend,&rsquo; he was not bad-looking; and these vouchers were
considered sufficient.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mudge was the widow of a tradesman in London.&nbsp; She was
better off than any of the other lodgers, and drank claret at twenty
shillings a dozen.</p>
<p>Miss Everard, the youngest of the party, was a French mistress, but
English by birth, and gave lessons in two or three schools.&nbsp; She
was never at home on weekdays excepting at breakfast and dinner.&nbsp;
After dinner she generally corrected exercises in her bedroom, but when
she was not busy she sat in the drawing-room to save fire and light.</p>
<p>Miss Taggart was the daughter of a country doctor.&nbsp; Both her
parents were dead, and she was poor.&nbsp; She had a reputation for
being enlightened, as she was not regular in her attendance at public
worship on Sunday, and did not always go to the same church.&nbsp; She
told Mrs. Poulter once that science should tincture theology, whereupon,
appeal being made to Mr. Goacher by that alarmed lady, he ventured to
remark, that with all respect to Miss Taggart, such observations were
perhaps liable to misconstruction in ordinary society, where they could
not be fully explained, and, although she was doubtless right in a way,
the statement needed qualification.&nbsp; Miss Taggart was not very
friendly with Mrs. Poulter and Mr. Goacher, and despised Mrs. Mudge
because she was low-bred.&nbsp; Miss Everard Miss Taggart dreaded, and
accused her of being vicious and spiteful.</p>
<p>It was still early in December, but the lodgers in Russell House
who had nothing to do - that is to say all of them excepting Miss Everard
- were making plans for Christmas.&nbsp; They always thought a long
time beforehand of what was going to happen.&nbsp; On Tuesday morning
they began to anticipate Sunday, and when the Sunday afternoon wore
away slowly and drearily, they looked forward to the excitement of omnibuses
and butchers&rsquo; carts on Monday.&nbsp; A little more than a fortnight
before Christmas, on Sunday at early dinner, a leg of mutton was provided.&nbsp;
Mrs. Poulter always sat at the head of the table and carved.&nbsp; This
was the position she occupied when Mr. Goacher came, and she did not
offer to resign it.&nbsp; Mrs. Mudge was helped first, but it was towards
the knuckle and she had no fat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Mrs. Poulter, but will you please give me a piece
of fat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Poulter, scowling, placed a minute portion of hard, half-burnt
skin on Mrs. Mudge&rsquo;s plate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much obliged, Mrs. Poulter, but I want a piece of <i>fat</i>
- white fat - just there,&rsquo; pointing to it with her fork.</p>
<p>Mrs. Poulter, as we have said, was at enmity with Mrs. Mudge.&nbsp;
Mrs. Mudge also was Low Church; and Mrs. Poulter was High.&nbsp; She
had just returned from a High Church service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, and
the demand for an undue share of fat was particularly irritating.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, Mrs. Mudge, you forget that there is hardly enough
to go round.&nbsp; For my part, though, I care nothing about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I had thought you did, Mrs. Poulter, I am sure I should
not have dared to ask for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; said Miss Taggart, &lsquo;that the office
of fat in diet is to preserve heat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If fat promotes heat,&rsquo; said Miss Everard, &lsquo;and
I have no doubt it is so, considering Miss Taggart&rsquo;s physiological
knowledge, my advice is that we abstain from it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pity,&rsquo; said Mr. Goacher, smiling, &lsquo;that
animals will not suit our requirements.&nbsp; But to be practical, Miss
Toller might be instructed to order legs of mutton with more fat.&nbsp;
This reminds me of beef, and beef reminds me of Christmas.&nbsp; It
is now the second Sunday in Advent, and there is a subject which you
will remember we had agreed to discuss this week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This important subject was a proposal by Mrs. Mudge that Miss Toller
should dine with them on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You, Mrs. Poulter,&rsquo; said Mr. Goacher, &lsquo;are of
opinion that we should not invite her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; I do not see how she is to send up the dinner
properly if she is to be our guest, and I imagine also she would not
be comfortable with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she be comfortable?&nbsp;
Of course, if we don&rsquo;t try to make her so she won&rsquo;t be.&nbsp;
There are ways to make people comfortable and ways to make them uncomfortable.&nbsp;
Miss Toller is just as good as any of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss T</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is not an educated woman, and I am
sure she would rather remain downstairs; our conversation would not
interest her.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray, Miss Taggart, what is an educated
woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss T</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a question, Miss Everard!&nbsp;
By an educated woman is meant a woman who has been taught the usual
curriculum of a lady in cultivated circles.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the curriculum of a cultivated
lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss T</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Really you are provoking; you understand
perfectly as well as I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am still in the dark.&nbsp; What is
the curriculum of a cultivated lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I much doubt if Miss Toller is acquainted
with the ordinary facts of geography, even those which are familiar
to common seamen in the Navy.&nbsp; She probably could not tell us the
situation of the Straits of Panama.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Poulter had been reading something in the newspaper the day
before about the Panama Canal.</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Straits of Panama!&rsquo; but she checked
herself when she saw that not a muscle moved on anybody&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, my dear Mrs. Poulter, I assure you I have friends who dine
in the best society, and I&rsquo;ll be bound they never heard of the
Straits of Panama.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;The society in which <i>I</i> was accustomed
to mix, Miss Everard, would have excluded a person who was so grossly
ignorant.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss T</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;The possession of scientific truth, in
addition to conferring social advantages, adds so much to our happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;This also I am inclined to dispute.&nbsp;
Do you really feel happier, Mrs. Poulter, because you can tell us what
continents are divided by the Straits of Panama?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lay a wager Miss Toller knows
as much as we do, but the things she knows aren&rsquo;t the things we
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. G</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are digressing, I am afraid.&nbsp;
I suggest we should have a ballot.&nbsp; I will write &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
on five little pieces of paper, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; on five, and after
distribution we will fold them up, and each of us shall drop one in
the vase on the mantel-shelf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was done, and there were three for the invitation and two against
it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Poulter and Mr. Goacher were left alone after the table was
cleared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Permit me to say, dear madam, that I entirely agreed with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have voted with Mrs. Mudge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did, but not from any sympathy with her views.&nbsp; I strive
to keep the peace.&nbsp; In an establishment like this concord is necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goacher, when he dropped his paper in the vase, had not forgotten
that Mrs. Mudge had offered to provide the wine for the dinner.&nbsp;
If she had been defeated the offer might have been withdrawn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have fancied before now that I have seen in you a decided
preference for Mrs. Mudge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was true.&nbsp; He had &lsquo;tried it on with her,&rsquo; to
use her own words, but she was impregnable.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was no good
with me,&rsquo; she said to Miss Everard; &lsquo;I saw what he was after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Mrs. Poulter, your supposition is preposterous - forgive
me - you do not suppose that I am unable to recognise superiority in
birth, in manners, and in intellect.&nbsp; It was better, on this particular
occasion, to conciliate Mrs. Mudge.&nbsp; She is not worthy of serious
opposition.&nbsp; Miss Toller will not sit near you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Poulter was pacified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear this explanation.&nbsp; I had hoped that
one might be forthcoming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am truly thankful I am worthy of hope, <i>truly</i> thankful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Poulter dropped Palmer&rsquo;s <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>,
which she had begun to read every Sunday afternoon for three months.&nbsp;
Mr. Goacher picked it up, and was about to take Mrs. Poulter&rsquo;s
hand, but Miss Taggart entered and the conversation closed just when
it was becoming interesting.</p>
<p>In a day or two Mrs. Poulter informed Miss Toller that the ladies
and Mr. Goacher had been pleased to express a wish that she should dine
with them on Christmas Day.&nbsp; She consented with becoming humility,
as even Mrs. Poulter confessed, but with many secret misgivings.&nbsp;
She desired to strengthen herself with her lodgers on whom her living
depended, but Helen was more than a servant.&nbsp; She was her friend,
and she could not bear the thought of leaving her in the kitchen.&nbsp;
Helen, too, was passionate and jealous.&nbsp; Miss Toller therefore
ventured to ask Mrs. Poulter whether, as it was Christmas, Helen also
might be invited.&nbsp; Mrs. Poulter signified to Miss Toller her extreme
surprise at the suggestion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The line, Miss Toller, must be drawn somewhere.&nbsp; Helen
will have the gratuity usual at this season - she is a well-regulated
person and will see the impropriety of intrusion into a sphere for which
she is unfit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Toller withdrew.&nbsp; She dared not venture to explain or apologise
to Helen, although delay would make matters worse.&nbsp; She went into
North Street and spent ten shillings which she could ill afford in buying
a locket for her.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve was black and bitter.&nbsp; After the lodgers had gone
to bed, Miss Toller and Helen sat by the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Miss, I wish we were at Barton Sluice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes you wish it, now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate this place and everybody in it, excepting you.&nbsp;
I suppose it&rsquo;s Christmas makes me think of the old farm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember you said once that you thought you would like a
town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I said so then.&nbsp; I should love to see them meadows
again.&nbsp; The snow when it melts there doesn&rsquo;t go to dirty,
filthy slush as it does in Brighton.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s the people
here I can&rsquo;t bear.&nbsp; I could fly at that Poulter and that
Goacher at times, no matter if I was had up for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You forget what a hard life you had with Mrs. Wootton at the
Hatch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t forget.&nbsp; She had a rough tongue, but
she was one of our set.&nbsp; She got as good as she gave.&nbsp; She
spoke her mind, and I spoke mine, and there was an end to it.&nbsp;
But this lot - they are so stuck-up and stuck-round.&nbsp; I never saw
such folk in our parts - they make me feel as if I were the dirt under
their feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind them.&nbsp; I have more to put up with than you
have.&nbsp; You know all; you may be sure, if I could help it, I shouldn&rsquo;t
be here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do know all.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t grieve if that stepmother
of yours drank herself to death.&nbsp; O Lord, when I see what you have
to go through I am ashamed of myself.&nbsp; But you were made one way
and I another.&nbsp; You dear, patient creature!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s half-past eleven.&nbsp; It is time to go to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went to their cold lean-to garrets under the slates.</p>
<p>Miss Toller lay awake for hours.&nbsp; This, then, was Christmas
Eve, one more Christmas Eve.&nbsp; She recollected another Christmas
Eve twenty years gone.&nbsp; She went out to a party, she and her father
and mother and sister; mother and sister now dead.&nbsp; Somebody walked
home with her that clear, frosty night.&nbsp; Strange!&nbsp; Miss Toller,
Brighton lodging-house keeper, always in black gown - no speck of colour
even on Sundays - whose life was spent before sinks and stoves, through
whose barred kitchen windows the sun never shone, had wandered in the
land of romance; in her heart also Juliet&rsquo;s flame had burned.&nbsp;
A succession of vivid pictures of her girlhood passed before her: of
the garden, of the farmyard and the cattle in it, of the river, of the
pollard willows sloping over it, of Barton Sluice covered with snow
- how still it was at that moment - the dog has been brought inside
because of the cold, and is asleep in the living-room - her father,
is he awake? the tall clock is ticking by the window, she could hear
its slow beats, and as she listened she fell asleep, but was presently
awakened by the bells proclaiming the birth in a manger.&nbsp; She remembered
that Mrs. Poulter had to be called at seven that she might go to an
early service.&nbsp; She hastily put on her clothes and knocked at the
door, but Mrs. Poulter decided that, as it was freezing, it would not
be safe to venture, and having ordered a cup of tea in her bedroom at
half-past eight, turned round and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>It was a busy day.&nbsp; The lodgers, excepting Miss Everard, went
to church in the morning, but Miss Toller and Helen had their hands
full.&nbsp; In the afternoon Miss Toller was obliged to tell Helen the
unpleasant news.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go, but I must not offend them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you <i>are</i> going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get out of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Helen did not speak another word.&nbsp; About half-past six Miss
Toller put on her best clothes and appeared in the dining-room.&nbsp;
Helen punctually served the dinner.&nbsp; A seat was allotted to Miss
Toller at the bottom of the table opposite Miss Everard and next to
Mr. Goacher, who faced Mrs. Poulter.&nbsp; Mrs. Mudge&rsquo;s wine was
produced, and Mr. Goacher graciously poured out a glass for Miss Toller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At this festive season, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A second glass was not offered, although Mrs. Mudge&rsquo;s supply
was liberal.&nbsp; Mr. Goacher did not stint himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are beautiful churches in Northamptonshire, I believe,
Miss Toller?&rsquo; said the reverend gentleman after the third glass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, very beautiful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! that is delightful.&nbsp; To whatever school in the Establishment
we belong, we cannot be insensible to the harmony between it and our
dear old ivy-clad towers and the ancient gravestones.&nbsp; I love old
country churches.&nbsp; I often wish my lot had been cast in a simple
rural parish.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you not go?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. G</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;My unfortunate throat; and besides, I
believe I am really better fitted for an urban population.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;In what way?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. G</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, you see, Miss Everard, questions
present themselves to our hearers in towns which do not naturally occur
to the rustic mind - questions with which, if I may say so, I am perhaps
fitted to deal.&nbsp; The rustic mind needs nothing more than a simple
presentation of the Gospel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;What kind of questions?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. G</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must be aware that our friend Mrs.
Poulter, for instance, accustomed as she is to the mental stimulus of
Southsea and Brighton, takes an interest in topics unfamiliar to an
honest agriculturist who is immersed all the week in beeves and ploughs
and swine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goacher had intended that Mrs. Poulter should hear that her name
was mentioned.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you saying about me?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing to your discredit.&nbsp; We were
talking about town and country parishes, and Mr. Goacher maintains that
in a town parish a clergyman of superior intellect is indispensable.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what has that to do with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss E</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, we merely brought you forward as
an example.&nbsp; You have moved in cultured society, and he is of opinion
that he is better fitted to preach to people like you than to farmers.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Culture, fiddle-de-dee!&nbsp; Afore I
was married, I lived in the country.&nbsp; Five-and-twenty years I lived
in it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me.&nbsp; A farmer with five hundred acres
of land, or even a cowman who has to keep a dozen cows in order and
look after his own garden, wants more brains than any of your fine town-folk.&nbsp;
Ah, and our old parson had a good bit more than any one of these half-witted
curates such as you see here in Brighton playing their popish antics
in coloured clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Poulter was very angry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Mudge,&rsquo; she said, speaking to nobody in particular,
and looking straight before her, &lsquo;has chosen to-day of all days
on which to insult, I will not call it <i>my</i> faith, but the faith
of the Catholic Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goacher at once intervened with his oil-can.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My leanings, Mrs. Poulter, have latterly at any rate been
in your direction - without excesses, of course; but both you and I
admit that the Church is ample enough to embrace the other great parties
so long as there is agreement in essentials.&nbsp; Unity, unity!&nbsp;
Mrs. Mudge&rsquo;s ardour, we must confess, proves her sincerity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goacher took another glass of Mrs. Mudge&rsquo;s wine.&nbsp;
After the dessert of almonds and raisins, figs, apples, and oranges
- also supplied by Mrs. Mudge - Miss Toller rose and said she hoped
she might be excused, but Mr. Goacher pressed her to stay.&nbsp; He
had offered to entertain the company with a trifling humorous composition
of his own.&nbsp; She consented, and he recited a parody on &lsquo;To
be or not to be,&rsquo; descriptive of a young lady&rsquo;s perplexity
at having received an offer of marriage.&nbsp; When it was over Miss
Toller departed.&nbsp; It was now nine o&rsquo;clock, and she found
that the dinner things had been washed up, and that Helen had gone to
bed.&nbsp; The next morning she went downstairs a little later than
usual, but there was no Helen.&nbsp; She ran up to her bedroom.&nbsp;
It was empty; she had slept there that night, but her box was packed
and directed, and there was a paper on it to say that the carrier would
call for it.&nbsp; Miss Toller was confounded.&nbsp; She would have
rushed to the station, but the first train had gone.&nbsp; She was roused
by the milkman at the area door, and hastened down to light the fire.&nbsp;
At first she resolved to excuse Helen&rsquo;s absence on the ground
that it was Boxing Day, but she would almost certainly not return, and
after breakfast Miss Toller went upstairs and told her lodgers that
Helen had left.&nbsp; Mrs. Poulter managed to acquaint Mr. Goacher and
Miss Taggart that she desired to speak to them when Mrs. Mudge and Miss
Everard were out of the way, and at midday there was a conference.&nbsp;
Mrs. Poulter declared that the time had now arrived for decisive action,
so far as she was concerned.&nbsp; Mrs. Mudge&rsquo;s behaviour could
not be endured.&nbsp; Her insolence in the matter of the newspaper (this
will be explained in a moment), and her contempt for what was sacred,
made it impossible without loss of self-respect to live with her.&nbsp;
The servant&rsquo;s sudden departure for reasons unknown, had, to use
Mrs. Poulter&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;put the coping-stone to the edifice.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The newspaper grievance was this.&nbsp; The <i>Morning Post</i> was
provided by Miss Toller for her boarders.&nbsp; Mrs. Poulter was always
the first to take it, and her claim as senior resident was not challenged.&nbsp;
One morning, however, Mrs. Mudge, after fidgeting for a whole hour,
while Mrs. Poulter leisurely scanned every paragraph from the top of
the first page down to the bottom of the last, suggested that the paper
should be divided, as other people might wish to see it.&nbsp; Mrs.
Poulter dropped her eye-glass and handed Mrs. Mudge the outside sheet,
with the remark that if she would but have intimated politely that she
was in a hurry, she could have had it before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m in no hurry,&rsquo; Mrs. Mudge replied, &lsquo;and
you don&rsquo;t seem to be in any.&nbsp; Thank you; this is not the
bit I want; you needn&rsquo;t trouble; I can order a paper myself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The next day there was a <i>Standard</i> for Mrs. Mudge, who with some
malice immediately offered it to Mr. Goacher.&nbsp; Mrs. Poulter glared
at him, and after a little hesitation he expressed his obligation but
preferred to wait, as he had a letter to write which must be dispatched
immediately.&nbsp; Mrs. Poulter never forgot Mrs. Mudge&rsquo;s spite,
as she called it; the <i>Standard</i> reminded her of it daily.</p>
<p>Mr. Goacher agreed with Mrs. Poulter that, for the reasons she gave,
it would be desirable to remove from Russell House.&nbsp; He also felt
that, as a clergyman, he would do wisely in leaving, for he could not
ascribe the disappearance of &lsquo;the domestic&rsquo; to anything
but a consciousness of guilt.</p>
<p>Miss Taggart considered that Mrs. Mudge&rsquo;s conduct was due to
defective training.&nbsp; As to Helen, Miss Taggart added that &lsquo;you
never feel yourself secure against moral delinquency in the classes
from which servants are drawn.&nbsp; They have no basis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand,&rsquo; said Mrs. Poulter, &lsquo;that Helen
is a Dissenter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Taggart, as the reader has been told, was not particularly fond
of Mrs. Poulter and Mr. Goacher, but to stay with Mrs. Mudge and Miss
Everard was impossible.&nbsp; She had also once or twice received a
hint from Miss Toller that perhaps she had better suit herself elsewhere,
as the minute attention she demanded to her little needs, of which there
were many, was trying both to mistress and servant.</p>
<p>Miss Toller was promptly informed that three of her lodgers were
going at the end of the month.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope, Mrs. Poulter, that you are not dissatisfied.&nbsp;
I have no doubt I shall soon be able to obtain assistance.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our reasons, Miss Toller, had better
not be communicated; they are sufficient.&nbsp; Against you personally
we have nothing to object.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss T</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you searched the box which I understand
has been left?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Toller</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you missed anything, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss T</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not at present.&nbsp; I might discover
my loss when it was too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. G</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be better for the protection
of all of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Toller</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it for worlds;
you&rsquo;ll pardon me for saying so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner you left
me without paying me a farthing.&nbsp; Helen may have her faults, but
she is as honest as - .&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Toller&rsquo;s voice trembled
and she could not finish the sentence.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you any reason to suspect any -
any improper relationship?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Toller</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not quite understand you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. G</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pardon me, Mrs. Poulter, it is my duty
to relieve you of that inquiry.&nbsp; Mrs. Poulter cannot be explicit.&nbsp;
Do you surmise that Helen is compelled to conceal? - you will comprehend
me, I am sure.&nbsp; I need not add anything more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor landlady, habitually crushed by the anticipation of quarter-day
into fear of contradiction or offence, flamed up with sudden passion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;Helen is my friend, my dearest
friend.&nbsp; How dare you! - you a clergyman!&nbsp; I let you and Mrs.
Poulter know that she is as pure and good as you are - yes, and a thousand
times better than you are with your hateful insinuations.&nbsp; I shalt
be thankful to see the last of you!&rsquo; and she flung herself out
of the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of that?&rsquo; said Mrs. Poulter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is beyond comment.&nbsp; We cannot remain another night.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Goacher and Miss Taggart agreed, and Miss Taggart was commissioned
at once to engage rooms.&nbsp; When she had gone Mr. Goacher was compelled
to explain that he was in a difficulty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, my dear Mrs. Poulter, after this open insult I
must go at once, but unhappily I am rather behind-hand in my payments
to Miss Toller.&nbsp; Remittances I expected have been delayed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much do you owe her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe it is now about fifteen pounds.&nbsp; Her disgraceful
conduct discharges us from any liability beyond to-day.&nbsp; Might
I beg the loan of twenty pounds from you? - say for a fortnight.&nbsp;
It is a favour I could not dream of soliciting from anybody but Mrs.
Poulter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was most inconvenient to Mrs. Poulter to advance twenty pounds
at that moment.&nbsp; But she had her own reasons for not wishing that
Mr. Goacher should imagine she was straitened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe I can assist you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goacher dropped on his knees and took the lady&rsquo;s hand,
kissing it fervently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear madam, may I take this opportunity, in this position,
of declaring what must be obvious to you, that my heart - yes, my heart
- has been captured and is yours?&nbsp; Identity of views on almost
every subject, social and religious, personal attachment beyond that
felt to any other woman I ever beheld - have we not sufficient reasons,
if you can but respond to my emotion, to warrant an Eden for us in the
future?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Goacher, you take me by surprise.&nbsp; I cannot conceal
my regard for you, but you will not expect an answer upon a matter of
such moment until I have given it most mature consideration.&nbsp; Miss
Taggart will be here directly: I think I hear the bell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goacher slowly rose: Miss Taggart appeared and announced that
the rooms were secured.</p>
<p>To end this part of the story, it may be added that in about a fortnight
Mr. Goacher&rsquo;s throat was quite well, and he announced to Mrs.
Poulter his intention of resuming active work in the Church.&nbsp; The
marriage, therefore, was no longer delayed.</p>
<p>A little while afterwards Mrs. Goacher discovered that her husband
had been a missionary in the service of the Church Missionary Society
and had consequently been Low, that he had been returned a little damaged
in character; and that resumption of active work was undesirable.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mudge had lunch and tea with a friend.&nbsp; When she came back
Miss Toller told her what had happened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ll blame me.&nbsp; It was wrong to let
my temper get the better of me, but I could not help it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Help it?&nbsp; The wonder to me is you&rsquo;ve stood it so
long.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t stand them; I should have left if they
hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Have they paid you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, that Goacher?&nbsp; Then he borrowed it!&rsquo; and
Mrs. Mudge laughed till she cried.</p>
<p>The day wore on and no carrier came for the box.&nbsp; After dinner
Miss Toller told Mrs. Mudge she must go out for a few minutes to get
a charwoman; that she would take the latch-key, and that nobody would
call.&nbsp; She had gone about a quarter of an hour when there was a
ring at the bell.&nbsp; Mrs. Mudge went to the door and, behold, there
was Helen!</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Lord have mercy on us!&nbsp; Why did you run away so suddenly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.&nbsp; Never you say a word about it to
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a sinner: where&rsquo;s Miss Toller?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Helen listened in silence as Mrs. Mudge told her the eventful history
of the last twelve hours.&nbsp; She went upstairs: Miss Toller&rsquo;s
bedroom door was open, and on the drawers she saw a little packet tied
up with blue silk.</p>
<p>It was addressed &lsquo;for dear Helen.&rsquo;&nbsp; She tore it
open, and there was a locket and in it was her beloved mistress&rsquo;s
hair - the mistress to whom she had been so cruel, who had so nobly
defended her.&nbsp; She threw herself on the bed and her heart almost
broke.&nbsp; Suddenly she leaped up, flew down into the kitchen, and
began washing up the plates and dishes.&nbsp; Miss Toller was away for
nearly an hour; her search for a charwoman was unsuccessful, and she
came back dejected.&nbsp; Helen rushed to meet her and they embraced
one another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Miss Toller, forgive me!&nbsp; When I saw you sitting with
that Poulter and that Goacher, the Devil got the better of me, but -
&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, my dear; I oughtn&rsquo;t to have gone, and never any
more from this day call me Miss Toller.&nbsp; Call me Mary, always from
this day - you promise me?&rsquo; and Miss Toller kissed Helen&rsquo;s
quivering lips.</p>
<p>Miss Toller did all she could to get other boarders, but none came
and she had a hard time.&nbsp; It was difficult for her sometimes to
find a dinner for herself and Helen.&nbsp; Good Mrs. Mudge was delicately
considerate and often said, &lsquo;that meat need not come up again,&rsquo;
and purposely ordered more than she and Miss Everard could eat, but
the butcher&rsquo;s bill and the milk bill were not paid so regularly
as heretofore.&nbsp; Worse than privation, worse than debt, was the
vain watching for inquiries and answers to her advertisement.&nbsp;
What would become of her?&nbsp; Where could she go?&nbsp; Three more
boarders she must have or she could not live, and there was no prospect
of one.&nbsp; If by great good luck she could obtain three, they might
not stay and the dismal struggle would begin again.&nbsp; Lodging-house
keepers are not the heroines of novels and poems, but if endurance,
wrestling with adversity, hoping in despair, be virtues, the eternal
scales will drop in favour of many underground basements against battlefields.&nbsp;
At last, after one or two pressing notices from landlord and rate-collector,
Mrs. Mudge and Miss Everard were informed that Russell House was to
be given up.&nbsp; She and Helen must seek situations as servants.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mudge and Miss Everard went away at the end of the month.&nbsp;
On the dining-room table after they had gone Miss Toller found two envelopes
directed to her.&nbsp; Inside were some receipts.&nbsp; Mrs. Mudge had
paid all the rent due to the end of Miss Toller&rsquo;s term, and Miss
Everard the taxes.&nbsp; Next week Miss Toller had the following letter
from her father</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;<i>MY DEAR MARY</i>, - This is to tell you that your stepmother
departed this life last Tuesday fortnight.&nbsp; She was taken with
a fit on the Sunday.&nbsp; On Tuesday morning she came to herself and
wished us to send for the parson.&nbsp; He was here in an hour and she
made her peace with God.&nbsp; I did not ask you to the funeral as you
had been so long away.&nbsp; My dear Mary, I cannot live alone at my
age.&nbsp; I was sixty-five last Michaelmas, and I want you back in
the old house.&nbsp; Let bygones be bygones.&nbsp; I shall always be,
your affectionate father,</p>
<p>&lsquo;THOMAS TOLLER.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>PS</i>. - You can have the same bedroom you had when your
own mother was alive.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The furniture, modern stuff, was sold, every stick of it, and Miss
Toller rejoiced when the spring sofa and chairs which had been devoted
to Poulters and Goachers and Taggarts were piled up in the vans.&nbsp;
The nightmares of fifteen years hid themselves in the mats and carpets.</p>
<p>Helen and she standing at the dresser ate their last meal in the
dingy kitchen of Russell House.&nbsp; It was nothing but sandwiches,
but it was the most delicious food they had tasted there.&nbsp; It is
a mistake if you are old to go back to the village in which you were
born and bred.&nbsp; Ghosts meet you in every lane and look out from
the windows.&nbsp; There are new names on the signboard of the inn and
over the grocer&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; A steam-engine has been put in the
mill, and the pathway behind to the mill dam and to the river bank has
been closed.&nbsp; The people you see think you are a visitor.&nbsp;
The church is restored, and there is a brand new Wesleyan chapel.&nbsp;
Better stay where you are and amuse yourself by trying to make flowers
grow in your little, smoky, suburban back-garden.&nbsp; But Miss Toller
and Helen were not too old.&nbsp; Mr. Toller met them at the station
with a four-wheeled chaise.&nbsp; Before the train had quite stopped,
Helen caught sight of somebody standing by the cart which was brought
for the luggage.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Tom! it&rsquo;s Tom!&rsquo;
she screamed; and it was Tom himself, white-headed now and a little
bent.&nbsp; She insisted on walking with him by the side of his horse
the whole four miles to their journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; He was between
forty and fifty when she went away and had been with Mr. Toller ever
since - &lsquo;tried a bit at times,&rsquo; he confessed, &lsquo;with
the second missus.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s with God, let us
hope,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;ll leave her alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They came to Barton Sluice.&nbsp; Flat and unadorned are the fields
there, and the Nen is slow, but it was their own land, they loved it,
and they were at rest.&nbsp; They fell into their former habits, and
the talk of crops, of markets, of the weather, and of their neighbours
was sweet.&nbsp; Mrs. Mudge and Miss Everard came now and then to see
them in summer time, and when Mr. Toller slept with his fathers, his
daughter and Helen remained at the farm and managed it between them.</p>

<h2>ESTHER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP FEN, 24<i>th</i> <i>November</i> 1838.</p>
<p>My Dear Esther, - This is your birthday and your wedding-day, and
I have sent you a cake and a knitted cross-over, both of which I have
made myself.&nbsp; I can still knit, although my eyes fail a bit.&nbsp;
I hope the cross-over will be useful during the winter.&nbsp; Tell me,
my dear, how you are.&nbsp; Twenty-eight years ago it is since you came
into the world.&nbsp; It was a dark day with a cold drizzling rain,
but at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night you were born, and the next morning
was bright with beautiful sunshine.&nbsp; Some people think that Blackdeep
must always be dreary at this time of year, but they are wrong.&nbsp;
I love the Fen country.&nbsp; It is my own country.&nbsp; This house,
as you know, has belonged to your father&rsquo;s forefathers for two
hundred years or more, and my father&rsquo;s old house has been in our
family nearly as long.&nbsp; I could not live in London; but I ought
not to talk in this way, for I hold it to be wrong to set anybody against
what he has to do.&nbsp; Your brother Jim is the best of sons.&nbsp;
He sits with me in the evening and reads the paper to me.&nbsp; He goes
over to Ely market every week.&nbsp; He has his dinner at the ordinary,
where many of the company drink more than is good for them, but never
once has he come home the worse for liquor.&nbsp; I had a rare fright
a little while ago.&nbsp; I thought there was something between him
and one of those Stanton girls at Ely.&nbsp; I saw she was trying to
catch him.&nbsp; It is all off now.&nbsp; She is a town girl, stuck-up,
spends a lot of money on her clothes, and would have been no wife for
Jim.&nbsp; She would not have been able to put her hand to anything
here.&nbsp; She might have broken my heart, for she would have tried
to draw Jim away from me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe, my dearest child,
in wedded love which lessens the love for father and mother.&nbsp; When
you were going to be married what agony I went through!&nbsp; It was
so wicked of me, for it was jealousy with no cause.&nbsp; I thank God
you love me as much as ever.&nbsp; I wish I could see you again at Homerton,
but the journey made me so ill last winter that I dare not venture just
yet. - Your loving mother,</p>
<p>RACHEL SUTTON.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, 27<i>th</i> <i>Nov</i>. 1838.</p>
<p>My Dearest Mother, - The cake was delicious: it tasted of Blackdeep,
and the cross-over will be most useful.&nbsp; It will keep me warm on
cold days, and the love that came with it will thicken the wool.&nbsp;
But, mother, it is not a month ago since you sent me the stockings.&nbsp;
You are always at work for me.&nbsp; You are just like father.&nbsp;
He gave us things not only on birthdays, but when we never looked out
for them.&nbsp; Do you remember that week when wheat dropped three shillings
a quarter?&nbsp; He had two hundred quarters which he might have sold
ten days earlier.&nbsp; He was obliged to sell them at the next market
and lost thirty pounds, but he had seen at Ely that day a little desk,
and he knew I wanted a desk, and he bought it for me with a fishing-rod
and landing-net for Jim.</p>
<p>My husband said he could not think of anything I needed and wrote
me a cheque for two pounds.</p>
<p>O! that you could come here, and yet I am certain you must not.&nbsp;
My heart aches to have you.&nbsp; In my day-dreams I go over the long
miles to Blackdeep, through Ware, through Royston, through Cambridge,
through every village, and then I feel how far away you are.&nbsp; I
turned out of the room the other day the chair in which you always sat.&nbsp;
I could not bear to see it empty.&nbsp; Charles noticed it had gone
and ordered it to be brought back.&nbsp; He may have suspected the reason
why I put it upstairs.&nbsp; My dearest, dearest mother, never fear
that my affection for you can become less.&nbsp; Sometimes after marriage
a woman loves her mother more than she ever loved her before.</p>
<p>It is a black fog here and not a breath of air is stirring.&nbsp;
How different are our fogs at Blackdeep!&nbsp; They may be thick, but
they are white and do not make us miserable.&nbsp; I never shall forget
when I was last in Fortyacres and saw the mist lying near the river,
and the church spire bright in the sunlight.&nbsp; The churchyard and
the lower part of the church were quite hidden.</p>
<p>What a mercy Jim was not trapped by Dolly, for I suppose it was she.&nbsp;
Jim is not the first she has tried to get.&nbsp; You are quite right.&nbsp;
She might have broken your heart, and I am sure she would have broken
Jim&rsquo;s, for she is as hard as a millstone. - Your loving child,</p>
<p>ESTHER.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP FEN, 3<i>rd December</i> 1838.</p>
<p>Your letter made me feel unhappy.&nbsp; I am afraid something is
on your mind.&nbsp; What is the matter?&nbsp; I was not well before
I went to Homerton the last time, but maybe it was not London that upset
me.&nbsp; If you cannot leave, I shall come.&nbsp; Let me hear by the
next post.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, 5<i>th</i> <i>December</i> 1838.</p>
<p>I told Charles I was expecting you.&nbsp; He said that your sudden
determination seemed odd.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your mother,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;is a woman who acts upon impulses.&nbsp; She ought always to
take time for consideration.&nbsp; This is hardly the proper season
for travelling.&rsquo;&nbsp; I asked him if he would let me go to Blackdeep.&nbsp;
He replied that, unless there was some particular reason for it, my
proposal was as unwise as yours.&nbsp; What am I to do?&nbsp; A particular
reason!&nbsp; It is a particular reason that I pine for my mother.&nbsp;
Can there be any reason more particular than a longing for the sight
of a dear face, for kisses and embraces?&nbsp; You must counsel me.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 15<i>th December</i> 1838.</p>
<p>As Charles imagines I am carried away by what he calls impulses,
I did not answer your letter at once, and I have been thinking as much
as I can.&nbsp; I am not a good hand at it.&nbsp; Your dear father had
a joke against me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rachel, you can&rsquo;t think; but never
mind, you can do much better without thinking than other people can
with it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I wish I had gone straight to you at once, and
yet it was better I did not.&nbsp; It would have put Charles out, and
this would not have been pleasant for either you or me.&nbsp; I would
not have you at Blackdeep now for worlds.&nbsp; The low fever has broken
out, and to-day there were two funerals.&nbsp; Parson preached a sermon
about it; it was a judgment from God.&nbsp; Perhaps it is, but why did
it take your father three years ago?&nbsp; It is all a mystery, and
it looks to me sometimes as if here on earth there were nothing but
mystery.&nbsp; I have just heard that parson is down with the fever
himself.</p>
<p>Do let me have a long letter at once.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, 20<i>th</i> <i>December</i> 1838.</p>
<p>A Mrs. Perkins has been here.&nbsp; She sat with me for an hour.&nbsp;
She spends her afternoons in going her rounds among her friends, as
she calls them, but she does not care for them, nor do they care for
her.&nbsp; She looks and speaks like a woman who could not care for
anybody, and yet perhaps there may be somewhere a person who could move
her.</p>
<p>I am so weary of the talk of my neighbours.&nbsp; It is so different
from what we used to have at Blackdeep.&nbsp; Oh me! those evenings
when father came in at dark, and Mr. and Mrs. Thornley came afterwards
and we had supper at eight, and father and Mr. Thornley smoked their
pipes and drank our home-brewed ale and we had all the news - how much
Mr. Thornley had got for his malt, how that pig-headed old Stubbs wouldn&rsquo;t
sell his corn, and how when he began to thresh it and the ferrets were
brought, a hundred rats were killed and bushels of wheat had been eaten.</p>
<p>You ask me what is the matter.&nbsp; I do not deny I am not quite
happy, but it would be worse than useless to dwell upon my unhappiness
and try to give you reasons for it.&nbsp; London, in the winter, most
likely does not suit me.&nbsp; I shall certainly see you in the spring,
and then I hope I shall be better.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP FEN, <i>Christmas Day</i>, 1838.</p>
<p>As a rule it is right to hide our troubles, but it is not right that
you should hide yours from me.&nbsp; You are my firstborn child and
my only daughter.&nbsp; There are girls who are very good, but between
their mothers and them there is a wall.&nbsp; They do what they are
bid; they are kind, but that is all.&nbsp; They live apart from those
that bore them.&nbsp; I would not give a straw for such duty and love.&nbsp;
I gathered one of our Christmas roses this morning.&nbsp; We have taken
great care to keep them from being splashed and spoilt.&nbsp; There
was not a speck on it.&nbsp; I put it in water and could not take my
eyes off it.&nbsp; Its white flower lay spread open and I could look
right down into it.&nbsp; I thought of you.&nbsp; When you were a little
one - ay, and after you were out of short frocks - you never feared
to show me every thought in your mind, you always declared that if you
had wished to hide anything from me, it would have been of no use to
try.&nbsp; What a blessing that was to me!&nbsp; How dreadful it would
be if, now that you are married, you were to change!&nbsp; I am sure
you will not and cannot.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, 1<i>st January 1839.</i></p>
<p>The New Year!&nbsp; What will happen before the end of it?&nbsp;
I feel as if it must be something strange.&nbsp; I have just read your
last letter again, and I cannot hold myself in.&nbsp; My dearest mother,
I confess I am wretched.&nbsp; It might be supposed that misery like
mine would express itself with no effort, but it is not so: it would
be far easier to describe ordinary things.&nbsp; I am afraid also to
talk about it, lest that which is dim and shapeless should become more
real.</p>
<p>Since the day we were married Charles and I have never openly quarrelled.&nbsp;
He is really good: he spends his evenings at home and does not seem
to desire entertainment elsewhere.&nbsp; He likes to see me well-dressed
and does not stint in house expenditure, although he examines it carefully
and pays a good many of the bills himself by cheque.&nbsp; He has been
promoted to be manager of the bank, and takes up his new duties to-day.&nbsp;
Mrs. Perkins, whose husband is one of the partners, told me that he
had said that there is nobody in the bank equal to Charles for sound
sense and business ability; that everything with which he has to do
goes right; he is always calm, never in a hurry, and never betrayed
into imprudence.&nbsp; This I can well believe.&nbsp; As you know, Jim
asked him a month ago in much excitement for advice about Fordham, who
owed him &pound;200.&nbsp; Jim had heard there was something wrong.&nbsp;
Charles put the letter in the desk and did not mention it to me again
till a week afterwards, when he asked me to tell Jim the next time I
wrote to Blackdeep that he need not worry himself, as Fordham was quite
safe.&nbsp; It is certainly a comfort to a woman that her husband is
a strong man and that he is much respected by his employers.&nbsp; Of
what have I to complain?&nbsp; O mother, life here is so dull!&nbsp;
This is not the right word; it is common, but if you can fill it up
with my meaning, there is no better.&nbsp; It will then be terrible.&nbsp;
There is hardly a flower in the garden, although not a weed is permitted.&nbsp;
The sooty laurels unchanging through winter and summer I hate.&nbsp;
Some flowers I am sure would grow, but Charles does not care for them.&nbsp;
Neatness is what he likes, and if the beds are raked quite smooth, if
the grass is closely shaven and trimmed and not a grain of gravel in
the path is loose, he is content.&nbsp; He cannot endure the least untidiness
in the house.&nbsp; If papers are left lying loosely about, he silently
puts them evenly together.&nbsp; He brings all his office ways into
the dining-room; the pens must never be put aside unwiped and the ink-bottles
must be kept filled to a certain height.&nbsp; We do not get much sun
at any time of day in Homerton, and we face the west.&nbsp; Charles
wishes the blinds to be drawn when it shines, so that it may not fade
the curtains.&nbsp; We have few books excepting Rees&rsquo;s cyclop&aelig;dia,
and they are kept in a glazed case.&nbsp; If I look at one I have to
put it back directly I have done with it.&nbsp; I saw this place before
I was married, but it did not look then as it looks now, and I did not
comprehend how much Blackdeep was a part of me.&nbsp; The front door
always open in daytime, the hollyhocks down to the gate, the strawberry
beds, the currant and gooseberry bushes, the lilacs, roses, the ragged
orchard at the back, the going in and out without &lsquo;getting ready,&rsquo;
our living-room with Jim&rsquo;s pipes and tobacco on the mantel-shelf,
his gun over it, his fishing-tackle in the corner - I little understood
that such things and the ease which is felt when our surroundings grow
to us make a good part of the joy of life.&nbsp; When I came to Blackdeep
for my holiday and lifted the latch, it was just as if a stiff, tight
band round my chest dropped from me.&nbsp; I have nothing to do here.&nbsp;
We keep three servants indoors.&nbsp; I would much rather have but two
and help a little myself.&nbsp; They are good servants, and the work
seems to go by mechanism without my interference.&nbsp; I suggested
to Charles that, as they were not fully employed, we should get rid
of one, but he would not consent.&nbsp; He preferred, he said, paid
service.&nbsp; To me the dusting of my room, paring apples, or the cooking
of any little delicacy, is not service.&nbsp; The cook asks for orders
in the morning; the various dishes are properly prepared; but if I were
Charles, and my wife understood her business, I should like to taste
her hand in them.&nbsp; I never venture into the kitchen.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
advantage of paid service,&rsquo; added Charles, &lsquo;is that if it
is inefficient you can reprimand or dismiss.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing in
me finds exercise.&nbsp; I want to work, to laugh, to expect.&nbsp;
There was always something going on at Blackdeep, no two days alike.&nbsp;
I never got up in the morning knowing what was before me till bedtime.&nbsp;
That outlook too from my window, how I miss it! - the miles and miles
of distance, the rainbow arch in summer complete to the ground, the
sunlight, the stormy wind, the stars from the point overhead to the
horizon far away - I hardly ever see them here.</p>
<p>You will exclaim &lsquo;Is this all?&rsquo;&nbsp; If you were here
you would think it enough, but it -&nbsp; The clock is striking one.&nbsp;
Charles is to be at home to lunch.&nbsp; He is going to buy the house
and is to meet the owner this afternoon, an old man who lives about
ten minutes&rsquo; walk from us.&nbsp; Charles thinks the purchase will
be a good investment and that another house might be built on part of
the garden.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 15<i>th</i> <i>January</i> 1839.</p>
<p>I am not surprised you find London dull, but I grieve that it has
taken such an effect on you.&nbsp; I hoped that, as you are young, you
would get used to the bricks and mortar and the smoke.</p>
<p>Jim came in and I had to stop.&nbsp; The Lynn coach is set fast in
the snow near the turnpike at the top of our lane, and he is going to
help dig it out.&nbsp; I will take up my pen again.&nbsp; You are no
worse off than thousands of country girls who are obliged to live in
streets narrower than those in Homerton.&nbsp; I cannot help boding
you are not quite free with me.&nbsp; I do beseech you to hide nothing.&nbsp;
There must even now be something the matter beyond what I have heard.&nbsp;
I cannot say any more at present.&nbsp; My head is in a whirl.&nbsp;
May be you will have a child.&nbsp; That will make all the difference
to you.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, 20<i>th</i> <i>January</i> 1839.</p>
<p>How shall I begin?&nbsp; I must tell the whole truth.&nbsp; Mother,
mother, I have made a great mistake, the one great mistake of life.&nbsp;
I have mistaken the man with whom I am to live.&nbsp; Charles and I
were engaged for two years.&nbsp; I have discovered nothing new in him.&nbsp;
I was familiar with all his ways and thought them all good.&nbsp; I
compared him with other men who were extravagant and who had vices,
and I considered myself fortunate.&nbsp; He was cool, but how much better
it was to be so than to have a temper, for I should never hear angry
words from him which cannot be forgotten?&nbsp; I remembered how measured
my uncle Robert&rsquo;s speech was, how quiet he was, and yet no two
human beings could have been more devoted to one another than uncle
and aunt.&nbsp; Charles&rsquo;s quietude seemed so like uncle&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Charles was very methodical.&nbsp; He always came to see me on the same
days, at the same hours, and stayed the same time.&nbsp; It provoked
me at first, but I said to myself that he was not a creature of fits
and starts and that I could always depend on him.</p>
<p>He always kissed me when we met and when we parted.&nbsp; I do not
remember that he ever had me in his arms, and I never felt he was warm
and eager when we were alone together; but I had heard of men and women
who married for what they called love, and in a twelvemonth it had vanished
and there was nothing left.&nbsp; Of many small particulars I took but
little notice.&nbsp; When we chose the furniture I wanted bright-coloured
curtains, but he did not like them and bought dark red, gloomy stuff.&nbsp;
I tried to think they were the best because they would not show the
London dirt.&nbsp; I had a bonnet with scarlet trimmings which suited
my black hair, but he asked me to change them for something more sober,
because they made me conspicuous.&nbsp; Again I thought he was right,
and that what might do for the country might not be proper in town.&nbsp;
Trifles! and yet to me now what a meaning they have!&nbsp; Two years
- and everything is changed, although, as I have just said, I have found
out nothing new!&nbsp; The quietude is absence of emotion, different
in its root from uncle Robert&rsquo;s serenity.&nbsp; It is the deadly
sameness of a soul to which nothing is strange and wonderful and a woman&rsquo;s
heart is not so interesting as an advertisement column in the newspaper.&nbsp;
He never cares to look into mine.&nbsp; I do not pretend that there
is anything remarkable in it, but if he were to open it he would find
something worth having.&nbsp; This absence of curiosity to explore what
is in me kills me.&nbsp; What must the bliss of a wife be when her husband
searches her to her inmost depths, when she sees tender questions in
his eyes, when he asks her <i>do you really feel so</i>? and she looks
at him and replies <i>and you</i>?&nbsp; I could endure the uneventfulness
of outward life if anything not unpleasant <i>happened</i> between me
and Charles.&nbsp; Nothing happens.&nbsp; Something happens in my relationship
to my dog.&nbsp; I pat him and he is pleased; he barks for joy when
I go out.&nbsp; I cannot live with anybody with whom I am always on
exactly the same even terms - no rising, no falling, mere stagnation.&nbsp;
I am dead, but it is death without its sleep and peace.&nbsp; Fool,
fool that I was!&nbsp; I cannot go on.&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp;
If Charles drank I might cure or tolerate him; if he went after another
woman I might win him back.&nbsp; I can lay hold of nothing.</p>
<p>A child?&nbsp; Ah no!&nbsp; I have longed unspeakably for a child
sometimes, but not for one fathered by him.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, <i>24</i>th <i>January</i> 1839.</p>
<p>I knew it all, but I dared not speak till you had spoken.&nbsp; Your
letter came when we were at breakfast.&nbsp; I could not open it, for
my heart told me what was in it.&nbsp; Jim wondered why I let it lie
on the table, and I made some excuse.&nbsp; After breakfast I took it
upstairs into my own room and sat down by the bed, your father&rsquo;s
bed, and cried and prayed.&nbsp; If he were alive he would have helped
me, or if no help could have been found he would have shared my sorrow.&nbsp;
It is dreadful that, no matter what my distress may be, he cannot speak.&nbsp;
What counsel can I send you?&nbsp; I have had much to do with affliction,
but not such as yours.&nbsp; My love for you is of no use.&nbsp; I will
be still.&nbsp; I have always found, when I am in great straits and
my head is confused, I must hold my tongue and do nothing.&nbsp; If
I do not move, a way may open out to me.&nbsp; Meantime, live in the
thought of Blackdeep and of me.&nbsp; It will do you no harm and may
keep you from sinking.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, <i>30</i>th <i>January</i> 1839.</p>
<p>No complaint, no reproof.&nbsp; You might have told me it was perhaps
my fault.</p>
<p>I always have to reflect on what I am about to say to him.&nbsp;
I go through my sentences to the end before I open my lips.&nbsp; He
dislikes exaggeration, and checks me if I use a strong word; but surely
life sometimes needs strong words, and those which are tame may be further
from the truth than those which burn.&nbsp; When he first began to think
about buying the house, I was surprised and talked with less restraint
than is usual with me.&nbsp; After a little while he said that I had
not contributed anything definite to a settlement of the question.&nbsp;
I dare say I had not, but it is natural to me to speak even when I do
not pretend to settle questions.&nbsp; He seems to think that speech
is useless unless for a distinct, practical purpose.&nbsp; At Blackdeep
almost everything that comes into my head finds its way to my tongue.&nbsp;
The repression here is unbearable.</p>
<p>Last night it rained, and Charles&rsquo;s overcoat was a little wet
at the bottom.&nbsp; He asked that it might be put to the fire.&nbsp;
Directly he came down in the morning he felt his coat and at breakfast
said in his slow way, &lsquo;My coat has not been dried.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I replied that I was very sorry, that I had quite forgotten it, and
that it should be dried before he was ready to start.&nbsp; I jumped
up, brought it into the room and hung it on a chair on the hearth-rug.&nbsp;
He did not thank me and appeared to take no notice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
indeed very sorry,&rsquo; I repeated.&nbsp; He then spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
do not care about the damp: it is the principle involved.&nbsp; I have
observed that you do not endeavour systematically to impress my requests
on your mind.&nbsp; If you were to take due note of them at the time
they are made, and say them aloud two or three times to yourself, they
would not escape your memory.&nbsp; Forgetfulness is never an excuse
in business, and I do not see why it should be at home.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;O Charles!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;do not talk about principles
in such a trifle; I simply forgot.&nbsp; I should be more likely to
forget my cloak than your coat.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did not answer me, but
opened a couple of letters, finished his breakfast, and then began to
write at the desk.&nbsp; I went upstairs, and when I returned to the
breakfast room he had gone.&nbsp; In the evening he behaved as if nothing
had passed between us.&nbsp; He would have thought it ridiculous if
such a reproof had unsettled a clerk at the bank, and why should it
unsettle me?&nbsp; The clerk expects to be taught his lesson daily.&nbsp;
So does every rational being.</p>
<p>Nothing! nothing!&nbsp; I can imagine Mrs. Perkins&rsquo; contempt
if I were to confide in her.&nbsp; &lsquo;As good a husband as ever
lived.&nbsp; What do you want, you silly creature?&nbsp; I suppose it&rsquo;s
what they call passion.&nbsp; You should have married a poet.&nbsp;
You have made an uncommonly good match and ought to be thankful.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A poet!&nbsp; I know nothing of poets, but I do know that if marriage
for passion be folly, there is no true marriage without it.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 7<i>th</i> <i>February</i> 1839.</p>
<p>I am no clearer now than I was a fortnight ago.&nbsp; I wish I could
talk to somebody, and then perhaps my thoughts would settle themselves.&nbsp;
Last Sunday I made up my mind I would come to you at all costs; then
I doubted, and this morning again I was going to start at once.&nbsp;
Now my doubts have returned.&nbsp; Jim notices how worried I am, and
I make excuses.</p>
<p>I cannot rest while I am not able to do more than put you off by
praying you to bear your lot patiently.&nbsp; It is so hard to stand
helpless and counsel patience.&nbsp; Could you give him up and live
here?&nbsp; I am held back, though, from this at present.&nbsp; I am
not sure what might happen if you were to leave him.&nbsp; Perhaps he
would be able to force you to return.&nbsp; You have no charge to make
against him which anybody but myself would understand.</p>
<p>I must still wait for the light which I trust will be given me.&nbsp;
It is wonderful how sometimes it strikes down on me suddenly and sometimes
grows by degrees like the day over Ingleby Fen.&nbsp; I lay in bed late
this morning, for I hadn&rsquo;t slept much, and watched it as it spread,
and I thought of my Esther in London who never sees the sunrise.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, 14<i>th</i> <i>February</i> 1839.</p>
<p>There is hardly anything to record - no event, that is to say - and
yet I have been swept on at a pace which frightens me.&nbsp; The least
word or act urges me more than a blow.&nbsp; Yesterday I made up my
accounts and was ten shillings short.&nbsp; I went over them again and
again and could not get them right.&nbsp; I was going to put into the
cash-box ten shillings of my own money, but I thought there might be
some mistake and that Charles, who always examines my books, would find
it out, and that it would be worse for me if he had discovered what
I had done than if I had let them tell their own tale.&nbsp; After dinner
he asked for them, counted my balance, and at once found out there was
ten shillings too little.&nbsp; I said I knew it and supposed I had
forgotten to put down something I had spent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Forgotten
again?&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;it is unsatisfactory: there is evident
want of method.&rsquo;&nbsp; He locked the box and book in the desk
and read the newspaper while I sat and worked.&nbsp; Next day I remembered
the servant had half-a-sovereign to pay the greengrocer, and I had not
seen her since I gave it to her.&nbsp; When Charles returned from the
bank my first words were, &lsquo;O Charles, I know all about the half-sovereign:
I am so glad.&rsquo;&nbsp; Would not you have acknowledged you were
glad too?&nbsp; He looked at me just as he did the night before.&nbsp;
I believe he would rather I had lost the money.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your explanation,&rsquo;
was his response, &lsquo;makes no difference: in fact it confirms my
charge of lack of system.&nbsp; I have brought you some tablets which
I wish you to keep in your pocket, and you must note in them every outgoing
at the time it is made.&nbsp; These items are then to be regularly adjusted,
and transferred afterwards.&rsquo;&nbsp; I could not restrain myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charles, Charles,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;do not <i>charge</i>
me, as if I had committed a crime.&nbsp; For mercy&rsquo;s sake, soften!&nbsp;
I have confessed I was careless; can you not forgive?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is much easier,&rsquo; was the answer, &lsquo;to confess and regret
than to amend.&nbsp; I am not offended, and as to forgiveness I do not
quite comprehend the term.&nbsp; It is one I do not often use.&nbsp;
What is done cannot be undone.&nbsp; If you will alter your present
habit, forgiveness, whatever you may mean by it, becomes superfluous.&rsquo;&nbsp;
His lips shut into their usual rigidity.&nbsp; Not a muscle in them
would have stirred if I had kissed them with tears.&nbsp; No tears rose;
I was struck into hardness equal to his own, and with something added.&nbsp;
I <i>hated</i> him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Henceforward,&rsquo; I said to myself,
&lsquo;I will not submit or apologise; there shall be war.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>16</i>th <i>February</i> 1839.</p>
<p>I left my letter unfinished.&nbsp; War?&nbsp; How can I make war
or continue at war?&nbsp; I could not keep up the struggle for a week.&nbsp;
I am so framed that I must make peace with those with whom I have disagreed
or I must fly.&nbsp; I would take nine steps out of the ten - nay, the
whole ten which divide me from dear friends; I would say that this or
that was not my meaning.&nbsp; I would abandon all arguing and wash
away differences with sheer affection.&nbsp; Toward Charles I cannot
stir.&nbsp; Sometimes, although but seldom, my brother Jim and I have
quarrelled.&nbsp; Five minutes afterwards we have been in one another&rsquo;s
arms and the angry words were as though they had never been spoken.&nbsp;
Forgiveness is not a remission of consequences on repentance.&nbsp;
It is simply love, a love so strong that in its heat the offence vanishes.&nbsp;
Without love - and so far Charles is right - forgiveness even of the
smallest mistake is impossible.</p>
<p>It is a thick, dark fog again this morning.&nbsp; At Blackdeep most
likely it is bright sunlight.</p>
<p>Charles does not seem to suspect that his indifference has any effect
on me.&nbsp; I suppose he is unable to conceive my world or any world
but his own.&nbsp; If he were at Blackdeep now and the sun were shining,
would it be to him a glowing, blessed ball of fire?</p>
<p>He may have just as much right to complain of me as I have to complain
of him.&nbsp; He sets store on the qualities necessary for his business,
and he knows what store the partners set on those qualities in him.&nbsp;
No doubt they are of great importance to everybody.&nbsp; It must be
hard for him to live with a woman who takes so little interest in city
affairs and makes so much of what to him is of no importance.&nbsp;
He looks down upon me as though I were not able to talk on any subject
which, for its comprehension, requires intelligence.&nbsp; If he had
married Miss Stagg, who has doubled the drapery business at Ely, they
might have agreed together very well.</p>
<p>This is true, but I come back to myself.&nbsp; The virtues are not
enough for me.&nbsp; Life with them alone is not worth the trouble of
getting up in the morning.&nbsp; I thirst for you: I shall come, whatever
may happen.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 20<i>th</i> <i>February</i> 1839.</p>
<p>I cannot write an answer to your letter.&nbsp; You must come.&nbsp;
I could not make up my mind last night, but this morning the light,
the direction, as my mother used to say, was like a star.&nbsp; How
you remind me of her! not in your lot but in your ways, and she had
your black hair.&nbsp; She was a stranger to these parts.&nbsp; Where
your grandfather first saw her I do not know, but she was from the hill
country in the far south-west.&nbsp; She never would hear anything against
our flats.&nbsp; When folk asked her if she did not miss the hills,
she turned on them as if she had been born in the Fens and said she
had found something in them better than hills.&nbsp; But how I do wander
on!&nbsp; That has nothing to do with you now, although I could tell
you, if it were worth while, how it came into my head.&nbsp; I shall
look out for you this week.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>LOMBARD STREET, 14<i>th</i> <i>March</i> 1839.</p>
<p>Dear Esther, - You have now been away three weeks and I shall be
glad to hear when you intend to return.&nbsp; Your mother I hope is
better, and if she is not, I trust you will see that your absence cannot
be indefinitely prolonged.&nbsp; I am writing at the Bank, and your
reply marked &lsquo;Private&rsquo; should be addressed here.&nbsp; Some
changes, now almost completed, are being made in the lower rooms at
Homerton which will give me one for any business of my own. - Your affectionate
husband,</p>
<p>CHARLES CRAGGS.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 17<i>th</i> <i>March</i> 1839.</p>
<p>Dear Charles, - My mother is not well, and I shall be grateful to
you if you will give me another week.&nbsp; I am sorry you have made
alterations in the house without saying anything to me.&nbsp; It will
be better now that I should not come back till they are finished. -
Your affectionate wife,</p>
<p>ESTHER CRAGGS.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, 19<i>th March</i> 1839.</p>
<p>The paperhangers and painters have left; the carpets will be laid
and the furniture arranged to-day.&nbsp; I trust to see you when I come
home on the 22nd instant.&nbsp; This will nearly give you the week you
desired.&nbsp; I shall be late at the Bank on the 22nd, but if you are
fatigued with your journey there is no reason why you should not retire
to rest, and we will meet in the morning.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 21<i>st</i> <i>March</i> 1839.</p>
<p>I had hoped for a little delay, for I shrank from the necessity of
announcing my resolve, although it has for some time been fixed.&nbsp;
I shall not return.&nbsp; The reason for my refusal shall be given with
perfect sincerity.&nbsp; I do not love you, and you do not love me.&nbsp;
I ought not to have married you, and I can but plead the blindness of
youth, which for you is a poor excuse.&nbsp; I shall be punished for
the remainder of my days, and not the least part of the punishment will
be that I have done you a grievous injury.&nbsp; Worse, however - ten
thousand times worse - would it be for both of us if we were to continue
chained together in apathy or hatred.&nbsp; I would die for you this
moment to make good what you have lost through me, but to live with
you as your wife would be a crime of which I dare not be guilty.&nbsp;
This is all, and this is enough.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>HOMERTON, 24<i>th</i> <i>March</i> 1839.</p>
<p>Madam, - I am not surprised at the contents of your letter of the
21st instant, nor am I surprised that your determination should have
been made known to me from your mother&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I have no
doubt that she has done her best to inflame you against me.&nbsp; How
she contrives to reconcile with her religion her advice to her daughter
to break a divine law, I will not inquire.&nbsp; I am not going to remonstrate
with you; I will not humiliate myself by asking you to reconsider your
resolution.&nbsp; I will, however, remind you of one or two facts, and
point out to you the consequences of your action, so that hereafter
you may be unable to plead you were not forewarned.</p>
<p>You will please bear in mind that <i>you</i> have abandoned <i>me</i>;
I have not abandoned you.&nbsp; You disappointed me: my house was not
managed in accordance with my wishes, but I was prepared to accept the
consequences of what I did deliberately and I desired to avoid open
rupture.&nbsp; I hoped that in time you would learn by experience that
the maxims which control my conduct rest on a solid basis; that I was
at least to be esteemed, and that we might live together in harmony.&nbsp;
I repeat, you have cast me off, though I was willing you should stay.</p>
<p>You confess you have done me a wrong, but have you reflected how
great that wrong is?&nbsp; I have no legal grounds for divorce, and
you therefore prevent me from marrying again.&nbsp; You have damaged
my position in the Bank.&nbsp; Many of my colleagues, envious of my
success, will naturally seize their opportunity and propagate false
reports, and I therefore inform you that I shall require of you a document
which my solicitor will prepare, completely exonerating me.&nbsp; This
will be necessary for my protection.&nbsp; A Bank manager&rsquo;s reputation
is extremely sensitive, and a notorious infringement of any article
of the moral code would in many quarters cause his commercial honesty
to be suspected.</p>
<p>You allege that you are sincere, but I can hardly acquit you of hypocrisy.&nbsp;
Your sentimental excuse for deserting me is suspicious.</p>
<p>When the document just mentioned has been signed, I shall send a
copy of it to the rector of your parish.&nbsp; Without it he will know
nothing but what you and your mother tell him, and he will be in a false
position.</p>
<p>I hereby caution you that I shall not lose sight of you, and if at
any time proof of improper relationship should be obtained, I shall
take advantage of it.</p>
<p>CHARLES CRAGGS.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 26<i>th</i> <i>March</i> 1839.</p>
<p>Dearest Mother, - This letter came this morning, and I send it at
once to you at Ely.&nbsp; Am I to answer it?&nbsp; When I read some
parts I wished he had been near me that I might have caught him by the
throat.&nbsp; I should have exulted that for once I could move him,
although it should be by terror.&nbsp; It is strange that not until
now did I know he was so brutal.&nbsp; Notice that, according to him,
if a wife leaves her husband it must be for a rival.&nbsp; He does not
understand how much she can hate him, body and soul, and with no thought
of a lover; that her loathing needs no other passion to inflame it,
and that the touch of his clean finger may be worse to her than a leper&rsquo;s
embrace.</p>
<p>When I had written so far I was afraid.&nbsp; I knelt down and cried
to our Father who is in Heaven. - Your loving daughter,</p>
<p>ESTHER.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>ELY, 28<i>th</i> <i>March</i> 1839.</p>
<p>You must not reply.&nbsp; I have always tried not to answer back
if it will do no good.&nbsp; In a way, I am not sorry he has written
in this style to you.&nbsp; It proves that the leading I had was true.&nbsp;
I feared cruel claws ever since I first set eyes on him notwithstanding
he was so even-tempered, and I am glad he has not shown them till you
are safe in Blackdeep.&nbsp; I know what you will have to go through
in time to come, but for all that I am sure I am right and that you
are right.&nbsp; I am more sure than ever.&nbsp; I am sorry for him,
but he will soon settle down and rejoice that you have gone.&nbsp; That
spiteful word about my religion does not disturb me.&nbsp; I have my
own religion.&nbsp; I have brought up my children in it.&nbsp; I have
taught them to fear God and to love the Lord Jesus Christ, who has stood
by me in all my troubles and guided me in all my straits whenever I
have been willing to wait His time.&nbsp; I bless God, my dear child,
that you have not gone away from your mother&rsquo;s faith - ay, and
your father&rsquo;s too - and that you can still pray to your Heavenly
Father in your distress.&nbsp; Be thankful you have been spared the
worst, that you have not grown hard.</p>
<p>I shall come back this week; your aunt wants you here, and a change
will do you good.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 10<i>th April</i> 1839.</p>
<p>I am glad you went to Ely, for yesterday the parson called to see
you.&nbsp; He had received a letter from Mr. Craggs, and considered
it his duty as a Christian minister to endeavour to bring about a reconciliation.&nbsp;
I told him at once he might spare himself the pains, for they would
be useless.&nbsp; He replied that I ought to think of the example.&nbsp;
Well, at that I broke out.&nbsp; I asked him whether that slut of a
Quimby girl wasn&rsquo;t a worse example, who at five-and-twenty had
married Horrocks, the hoary old wretch, for his money, and leads him
a dog&rsquo;s life?&nbsp; Had he ever warned either of them?&nbsp; They
go to church regular.&nbsp; I was very free, and I said I thought it
was a bright example that a woman should have given up a fine house
and money in London because there was no love with them, and should
have come back to her mother at Blackdeep.&nbsp; Besides, I added, why
should my Esther suffer a living death for years for the sake of the
folk hereabouts?&nbsp; They weren&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp; She was too
precious for that.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; but he went on again, &lsquo;they
have souls to be saved.&nbsp; Husbands and wives may be led to imagine
there is no harm in separating, and may yield to the temptations of
unlawful love.&rsquo;&nbsp; This made me very hot, and I gave it him
back sharp that a sinner could find in the Bible itself an excuse for
his sin.</p>
<p>He said no more except that it would be a nice scandal for the Dissenters,
and that he trusted God would bring me into a better frame of mind.&nbsp;
He then went away.&nbsp; His reasoning went in at one ear and out at
the other.&nbsp; Parsons are bound to preach by rule.&nbsp; It is all
general: it doesn&rsquo;t fit the ins and outs.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>BLACKDEEP, 1<i>st May</i> 1839.</p>
<p>You had better stop at Ely as long as you can.&nbsp; Everybody is
gossiping, for parson has told the story as he heard it from your husband.&nbsp;
It is worse for Jim than for me, as he goes about among people here,
and although they daren&rsquo;t say anything to him about you, there
is no mistake as to what they think.&nbsp; Mrs. Horrocks inquired after
me, and said she was sorry to hear of my trouble.&nbsp; Jim told her
I was quite well, and that the two cows were now all right.&nbsp; He
wouldn&rsquo;t let her see he knew what she meant.</p>
<p>Last night, Jim, who has been talking for a twelvemonth past about
going to his cousin in America, asked me whether I would not be willing
to leave.&nbsp; I have always set my face against it.&nbsp; To turn
my back on the old house and the Fen, to begin again at my time of life
in a new strange world would be the death of me.&nbsp; More than ever
now am I determined to end my days here.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d say at once
we had fled.&nbsp; No, here we&rsquo;ll bide and face it out.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>They did not fly.&nbsp; Years went on, and to the astonishment of
their neighbours - perhaps they were a little sorry - there was no sign
that Esther had a lover.&nbsp; Mrs. Horrocks&rsquo;s eyes were feline,
but she was obliged to admit she was at fault.&nbsp; Jim married, and
an agreeable opportunity was presented for the expression of amazement
that his wife&rsquo;s father and mother felt safe in allowing their
child to enter such a family - but then she came from Norwich.&nbsp;
The majority of the poor in Blackdeep Fen sided with the Suttons, and
here and there a pagan farmer boldly declared that old Mrs. Sutton and
her daughter were of a right good sort, and that there was not a straightforrarder
man than Jim in Ely market.&nbsp; But to respectable Blackdeep society
the Suttons remained a vexatious knot which it could not unpick and
lay straight.&nbsp; Nobody, as Mrs. Horrocks observed, knew how to take
them.&nbsp; Mrs. Craggs wore her wedding-ring, and when she was in Mrs.
Jarvis&rsquo;s shop looked her straight in the face and asked for what
she wanted as if she were the parson&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; But that, according
to Mrs. Horrocks, just showed her impudence.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a time
that poor Craggs in London must have had of it:&rsquo; (Mr. Horrocks
was not present).&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord! how I do pity the man.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; added Mrs. Jarvis, &lsquo;and <i>yet</i>, you
might eat your dinner off Mrs. Craggs&rsquo;s floor.&nbsp; I call it
hers, for she cleans it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Clearly the living-room ought
to have been a pigsty.&nbsp; It was particularly annoying that, although
Mrs. Sutton and her family by absence from church had become infidels,
they did not go to the devil openly as they ought to do, and thereby
relieve Blackdeep of that pain and even hatred which are begotten by
an obstinate exception to what would otherwise be a general law.&nbsp;
Parson often preached that everybody was either a sheep or a goat.&nbsp;
The Suttons were not sheep - that was certain; and yet it was difficult
to classify them as ordinary Blackdeep goats, creatures with horns.&nbsp;
Mrs. Jarvis had heard that there was a peculiar breed of goats with
sheep&rsquo;s wool and without horns.&nbsp; &lsquo;Esther Craggs,&rsquo;
she maintained, &lsquo;will one day show us what she&rsquo;s after;
mark my word, you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; If that brazen face means nothing,
then I&rsquo;m stone-blind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After Jim&rsquo;s marriage Esther continued to manage the house and
the dairy, leaving the cooking to her sister-in-law and the needlework
to her mother.&nbsp; Soon after five o&rsquo;clock on a bright summer
morning the labourer going to his work heard the unbarring of Mrs. Sutton&rsquo;s
shutters and the withdrawal of bolts.&nbsp; The casement windows and
the door were then flung open, and Esther generally came into the doorway
and for a few minutes faced the sun.&nbsp; She did not shut herself
up.&nbsp; She walked the village like a queen, and no Fen farmer or
squireling ventured to jest with her.&nbsp; Mrs. Jarvis could not be
brought to admit her stone-blindness and clung to the theory of somebody
in London; but as Esther never went to London, and nobody from London
came to her, and the postmistress swore no letters passed between London
and the Sutton family, Mrs. Jarvis became a little distrusted, although
some of her acquaintances believed her predictions with greater firmness
as they remained unfulfilled.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you
may say; don&rsquo;t tell me,&rsquo; was her reply to sceptical objections,
and it carried great weight.</p>
<p>Esther died of the Blackdeep fever in the fifth year after she came
home.&nbsp; As soon as he received the news of her death Mr. Craggs
married Mrs. Perkins, who had been twelve months a widow, was admitted
into partnership, and is now one of the most respected men in the City.</p>

<h2>KATE RADCLIFFE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In 1844 there were living between Carlisle and Keswick, Robert Radcliffe
and his only child Kate.&nbsp; They belonged to an ancient Roman Catholic
family, remotely connected with the Earl of Derwentwater who was executed
in 1716; but Robert Radcliffe&rsquo;s father had departed from the faith
of his ancestors, and his descendants, excepting one, had remained Protestant.&nbsp;
Robert had inherited a small estate and had not been brought up to any
profession.&nbsp; He had been at Cambridge, and at one time it was thought
he might become a clergyman, but he had no call that way, and returned
to Cumberland after his father&rsquo;s death to occupy himself with
his garden and books.&nbsp; He was a good scholar and had a library
of some three thousand volumes.&nbsp; He married when he was about eight-and-twenty,
but his wife died two years after Kate was born, and he did not marry
again.&nbsp; He took no particular pleasure in field sports except angling,
nor in the gaieties of county society, although he was not a recluse
and was on friendly terms with most of his neighbours.&nbsp; He was
fond of wandering in his own country, and knew every mountain and every
pass for twenty miles round him.&nbsp; His daughter was generally his
companion, sometimes on her pony and sometimes on foot.&nbsp; Neither
of them had been abroad, save once to France when she was about sixteen.&nbsp;
They cared little for travelling in foreign parts, and he always said
he got nothing out of a place in which he was a lodger.&nbsp; He went
once a Sunday to the village church: he was patron of the living.&nbsp;
The sermons were short and simple.&nbsp; Theological questions did not
much concern him, and he found in Horace, Montaigne, Swift, and the
County History whatever mental exercise he needed.&nbsp; So far he was
the son of his father, but his mother had her share in him.&nbsp; She
was a strange creature, often shaken by presentiments.&nbsp; Years after
she was married her husband had to go to Penrith on some business which
she knew would keep him there for a night.&nbsp; She got it into her
head when she was alone in the evening that something had happened to
him.&nbsp; She could not go to bed nor sit still, and at three o&rsquo;clock
in the morning she called up her servant and bade him saddle his horse
and hers.&nbsp; Off they started for Penrith, and she appeared before
her astonished husband just as he was leaving his room at the inn for
an early breakfast.&nbsp; She rushed speechless into his arms and sobbed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing wrong at home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She passed her hands slowly over his face as if to reassure herself,
pushed back his hair, looked in his eyes, took both his hands and said
softly, &lsquo;Not another word, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He understood her, at least in part.&nbsp; She remained quietly at
the inn till the afternoon and then went home with him.&nbsp; She was
also peculiar in her continual reference to first principles.&nbsp;
The meaningless traditions, which we mistake for things, to her were
nothing.&nbsp; She constantly asked, &lsquo;why not?&rsquo; and was
therefore dangerous.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you go on asking &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;&rsquo;
said her aunt to her once, &lsquo;mark me you&rsquo;ll come to some
harm.&rsquo;&nbsp; She saw realities, and yet - it was singular - she
saw ghosts.&nbsp; Mr. Radcliffe did not obviously resemble his mother,
nor did Kate, and yet across both of them there often shot clear, and
at times even flashing gleams, indisputable evidence that in son and
granddaughter she still lived.&nbsp; It was in his relationship to his
daughter that Mr. Radcliffe betrayed his mother&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp;
His reading, as we have said, was in Horace, Montaigne, and Swift, but
if Kate went away for no longer than a couple of days to her cousins
at Penrith, he used to watch her departure till she was hidden at the
first bend of the road about half a mile distant, and then when he went
back to his room and looked at her empty chair, a half-mad, unconquerable
melancholy overcame him.&nbsp; It was not to be explained by anxiety.&nbsp;
It was inexplicable, a revelation of something in him dark and terrible.&nbsp;
In 1844 Kate Radcliffe was twenty-four years old.&nbsp; She had never
been handsome, and when she was sixteen her pony had missed its footing
on a treacherous mountain track and she narrowly escaped with her life.&nbsp;
She was thrown on a rock, and her forehead was crossed henceforth beyond
remedy with a long broad mark.&nbsp; She had never cared much for company,
and her disfigurement made her care for it less.&nbsp; She could not
help feeling that everybody noticed it, and most people in truth noticed
nothing else.&nbsp; She was &lsquo;the girl with a scar.&rsquo;&nbsp;
As time went on, this self-consciousness, or rather consciousness of
herself as the scar, diminished, but her indifference remained, other
reasons for it being added.&nbsp; She never had a lover; and, indeed,
what man could be expected to take to himself as wife even the wisest
and most affectionate of women whose brow was indented?&nbsp; She was
advised to wear some kind of head-gear which would hide her misfortune,
but she refused.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everybody,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;would
know what was behind, and I will not be harassed by concealment.&rsquo;&nbsp;
To her father her accident did but the more endear her.&nbsp; There
is no love so wild, no, not even the love of a mistress, as that which
is sometimes found in a father or mother for a child, and often for
one who is physically or even mentally defective.&nbsp; It is not subject
to satiety and lassitude, and grows with age.&nbsp; To Kate also her
father was more than the whole world of men and women.&nbsp; The best
of friends weary of one another and large spaces of separation are necessary,
but these two were always happy together.&nbsp; Theirs was the blessed
intimacy which is never unmeaning and yet can endure silence.&nbsp;
They never felt that unpleasant stricture of the chest caused by a search
for entertainment or for some subject of conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although Mr. Radcliffe was so much to Kate, she was
herself, and consequently had wants which were not his.&nbsp; There
had been born in her before 1844 a passion which could not be satisfied
by any human being, a leaning forward and outward to something she knew
not what.&nbsp; The sun rose over the fells; they were purple in sunset;
the constellations slowly climbed the eastern sky on a clear night,
and her heart lay bare: she wondered, she was bowed down with awe, and
she also longed unspeakably.&nbsp; When she was about twenty-five years
old she accepted an invitation to spend a few weeks with a friend in
London.&nbsp; She was fond of music, and on her first Sunday she could
not resist the temptation to hear a mass by Mozart in Saint Mary&rsquo;s,
Moorfields.&nbsp; She was overpowered, and something moved in her soul
which she had never felt in the church at home.&nbsp; She worshipped
at Saint Mary&rsquo;s several times afterwards, and her friend rallied
her on conversion to Roman Catholicism.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the music, Kate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The music is so tender, so overwhelming, that thinking is
impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is thinking the only way to the truth - putting two and two
together?&nbsp; The noblest truth comes with music.&nbsp; More solid
truth has been demonstrated by a song, a march, or a hymn, than by famous
political and theological treatises.&nbsp; But I am not a Roman Catholic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes!&nbsp; I know what you mean: it is a poetical way of
saying that music stimulates aspiration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, that is not what I mean.&nbsp; If there be such a mental
operation as passionless thinking it does not lead to much.&nbsp; Emotion
makes intellectual discoveries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not understand you.&nbsp; Revealed religion rests on
intelligent conviction.&nbsp; It is the doctrine of a Creator, of law,
of sin, of redemption, of future happiness and misery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is to say, your religion stands on authority or logic.&nbsp;
But I cannot dispute with you.&nbsp; The beliefs by which some of us
live - &ldquo;belief&rdquo; is not the right word - are not begotten
or strengthened and cannot be overthrown by argument.&nbsp; We dare
not expose them, but if they were to fail, we should welcome death and
annihilation.&nbsp; I repeat, I am not a Roman Catholic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kate went back to her father and her native hills.&nbsp; The drama
of Saint Mary Moorfields was continually before her eyes, and Mozart&rsquo;s
music was continually in her ears.&nbsp; An ideal human being had been
revealed to her who understood her, pitied her, and loved her.&nbsp;
She was no longer a mere atom of dust, unnoticed amongst millions of
millions.&nbsp; But the intensity of her faith gave birth to fear and
doubt.&nbsp; Her own words recurred to her, but she was forced to admit
that she must depend upon evidence.&nbsp; If Christ were nothing but
a legend, she might as well kneel to a mist.</p>
<p>In those days, within five miles of her father&rsquo;s house was
a small Roman Catholic chapel.&nbsp; The priest had been well educated,
but he had never questioned any of the dogmas imposed on him as a child.&nbsp;
One Sunday morning, when her father did not go to church, Kate walked
over to the chapel and heard mass.&nbsp; The contrast with Saint Mary
Moorfields was great.&nbsp; The sermon disappointed her.&nbsp; It was
little more than simple insistence on ritual duty.&nbsp; She reflected,
however, that it was not addressed to her, but to those who had been
brought up to believe.&nbsp; As she walked home a strange conflict arose
in her.&nbsp; On the one hand were her imperious needs, which almost
compelled assumption of fact; but the wind blew, and when she looked
up the clouds sailed over the mountains.&nbsp; She sat on a grey rock
to rest.&nbsp; It had lain there for thousands of years, and she was
reminded of the Druid circle above the Greta.&nbsp; She could get no
further with her thinking, and knelt down and prayed for light.&nbsp;
It is of all prayers the most sincere, but she was not answered - at
least not then.&nbsp; The next Sunday she went again to mass, and she
had half a mind to signify her wish to confess, but what could she confess?&nbsp;
She was burdened with no sins, and in confession she could not fully
explain her case.&nbsp; She determined she would write to the priest
and ask him to grant her an interview.</p>
<p>Her desertion of the parish church was observed, and of course nobody
was surprised that Miss Radcliffe had turned Papist.&nbsp; The old Radcliffes
were all Papists; there was Popery in the blood, and it came out like
the gout, missing a couple of generations.&nbsp; Then again there was
the scar, and Miss Radcliffe would never be married.&nbsp; One of the
neighbours who suggested the scar and maidenhood as a sufficient reason
for apostasy was a retired mill-owner, who was a Wesleyan Methodist
when he was in business in Manchester, but had become ostentatiously
Anglican when he retired into the country.&nbsp; The village blacksmith,
whose ancestors had worked at the same forge since the days of Queen
Elizabeth, was a fearless gentleman, and hated the mill-owner as an
upstart.&nbsp; He therefore made reply that &lsquo;other people changed
their religion because they wanted to be respectable and get folk like
the Radcliffes to visit them - which they won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; the last
words being spoken with emphasis and scorn.</p>
<p>Mr. Radcliffe was much disturbed.&nbsp; To him Roman Catholicism
was superstition, and he wondered how any rational person could submit
to it.&nbsp; To be sure he assented every week to supernatural history
and doctrines presented to him in his own parish church, but to these
he was accustomed, and his reason, acute as it was, made no objection.&nbsp;
There was another cause for his distress.&nbsp; His only sister, whom
he tenderly loved, had become a foreign nun and was lost to him for
ever.&nbsp; His life was bound up with his child, and he dreaded intervention.&nbsp;
It is all very well to say that religious differences need not be a
bar to friendship.&nbsp; This is one of the commonplaces of people who
understand neither friendship nor religion.&nbsp; When Kate and he went
for their long walks together, they would no longer see the same hills;
and there would always be something behind her affection for him and
above it.&nbsp; He was moodily jealous, and it was unendurable that
he should be supplanted by an intruder who would hear secrets which
were not entrusted to a parent.&nbsp; There was still some hope.&nbsp;
He did not know how far she had gone; and he resolved to speak to her.&nbsp;
One morning, as soon as breakfast was over, he proposed an excursion;
he could talk more freely in the open air.&nbsp; After a few minutes&rsquo;
indifferent conversation he asked her abruptly if she was a Roman Catholic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cannot say!&nbsp; Do you still belong to our church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, do not question me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I see what has happened; it is lawful to hide from
me, to prevaricate and perhaps&rsquo; - he checked himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
know that ever since you have grown up I have hidden nothing from you.&nbsp;
I have told you everything about my own affairs: I have asked your counsel,
for I am old, and the wisdom of an old man is often folly.&nbsp; You
have also told me everything: you have opened your heart to me.&nbsp;
Think of what you have said to me: I have been mother and father to
you.&nbsp; The trouble to me is not merely that you believe in transubstantiation
and I do not, but that there is something in you which you reserve for
a stranger.&nbsp; What has come to you? - for God&rsquo;s sake keep
close to me for the few remaining years or months of my life.&nbsp;
Have you reflected on the absurdities of Romanism?&nbsp; Is it possible
that my Kate should kneel at the feet of an ignorant priest!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was silent.&nbsp; She knew as little as her father of Roman Catholic
history and creeds.</p>
<p>He went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your aunt, my dear sister - a more beautiful creature never
walked this earth - I do not know if she is alive or dead.&nbsp; Can
that be true which kills love?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, father,&rsquo; she cried, sobbing, &lsquo;nothing
can separate us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said no more on that subject, and seemed to recover his peace
of mind, although he was not really at rest.&nbsp; He was getting into
years and he saw that words were useless and that he must wait the issue
of forces which were beyond his control.&nbsp; &lsquo;If she is to go,
she must go: resistance will make it worse for me: I must thank God
if anything of her is left for me.&nbsp; Thus spoke the weary submission
of age, but it was not final, and the half-savage desire for his child&rsquo;s
undivided love awoke in him again, and he prayed that if he could not
have it his end might soon come.</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s love for her father was deep, but she could not move
a single step merely to pacify him.&nbsp; She could have yielded herself
entirely to him in worldly matters; she would have doubted many of her
strongest beliefs if he had contested them; she would have given up
all her happiness for him; she would have died for him; but she could
not let go the faintest of her religious dreams, although it was impossible
to put them into words.</p>
<p>She wrote her letter to the priest.&nbsp; She found him living in
a cottage and was somewhat taken aback when she entered.</p>
<p>There were hardly any books to be seen, but a crucifix hung on the
wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Radcliffe - an old and honoured name!&nbsp; What can
be the object of your visit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, I am in distress.&nbsp; I want something which perhaps
you can give.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, my child, I understand.&nbsp; You would like to confess,
but you are Protestant; I cannot absolve you.&nbsp; Return to the true
fold and you can be released.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Father, I have committed no crime; I come to you because
I doubt and I <i>must</i> believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The holy father was unused to such a penitent, and was perplexed
and agitated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doubt, my child - yes, even the faithful are sometimes troubled
with doubt, a temptation from the Enemy of souls.&nbsp; Were you one
of the flock I could prescribe for you.&nbsp; But perhaps you mean doubt
of the heresies of your communion.&nbsp; In that case I can recommend
a little manual.&nbsp; Take it away with you, study it, and see me again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said Kate, pointing to the crucifix, &lsquo;did
He, the Son of God, Son of the Virgin, really live on this earth? did
He break His heart for me?&nbsp; If He did, I am saved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely your own minister has instructed you on this point;
it is the foundation even of Protestantism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I prefer to seek instruction and guidance from you; answer
me this one question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Satan has never thus assaulted me, and I have never heard
of any such suggestion to one of my people.&nbsp; I am a poor parish
priest.&nbsp; Take the manual.&nbsp; It has been compiled by learned
men: read it carefully with prayer: I also will pray for you that you
may be gathered into the eternal Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kate took the manual and went home.&nbsp; There was but little history
in it, but there was much about the person of Christ.&nbsp; He was man
and God &lsquo;without confusion and without change.&rsquo;&nbsp; As
man he had to learn as other men learn, and, as God, he knew everything.&nbsp;
He was sinless, and the lusts of the flesh had no power over him, but
he had a human body, and was necessarily subject to its infirmities.&nbsp;
His human nature was derived from his mother.&nbsp; God was not born
from her, and yet she was the mother of God.&nbsp; Kate was able to
see that some part of what looked like sheer contradiction was the conjunction
of opposites from which it is impossible to escape in the attempt to
express the Infinite, but in the manual this contradiction was presented
with repulsive hardness.&nbsp; The compiler desired to subjugate and
depose the reason.&nbsp; This was not the Christ she wanted.&nbsp; She
hungered for the God, the Man, at whose feet she could have fallen:
she would have washed them with tears, she would have wiped them with
the hair of her head, and kissed them and anointed them with ointment.&nbsp;
She could have followed Him to the court of the High Priest and have
gloried in discipleship: she could have taken the thief&rsquo;s place
beside Him on the cross, and she would not have exchanged those moments
of torture in companionship with Him for a life of earthly bliss.&nbsp;
But - that fatal <i>but</i> - did He ever live, did He still live, did
He love her, did He know how much she loved Him?&nbsp; Thus it has always
been.&nbsp; There is an impulse in man which drives him to faith; the
commonplace world does not satisfy him; he is forced to assume a divine
object for his homage and love, and when he goes out into the fields
it has vanished.</p>
<p>Kate did not call again upon the priest.&nbsp; Her father came to
the conclusion that there was nothing in his suspicions, and that she
had been suffering from one of her not uncommon fits of nervous restlessness
and depression.&nbsp; This was a mercy, for his bodily health had begun
to fail.&nbsp; The winter was very severe, and in the dark days just
before Christmas he took to his bed and presently died, having suffered
no pain and with no obscuration of his mind until the last ten minutes.&nbsp;
Kate had nursed him with pious care: she was alone with him and closed
his eyes about four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; At first she
was overcome with hysterical passion, and this was succeeded by shapeless
thoughts which streamed up in her incessantly as the mists stream up
from a valley at sunrise.&nbsp; Not until day broke did she leave the
room and waken the household.</p>
<p>An epoch is created rather by the person than by the event.&nbsp;
The experience which changes one man is nothing to another.&nbsp; Some
will pass through life without a mark from anything that happens to
them; others are transformed by a smile or a cloud.&nbsp; So also the
same experience will turn different men into totally different paths.&nbsp;
Kate had never seen death before.&nbsp; It smote her with such force
that for months and months her father was before her eyes and she could
not convince herself that he was not with her.&nbsp; But she went no
further towards Roman Catholicism.&nbsp; She let the facts stand.&nbsp;
Once when she was walking on the moors she stretched out her arms again
and was urged to pray, but she felt that her prayer would be loss of
strength and she stood erect.&nbsp; For nearly a twelvemonth she simply
endured.&nbsp; She remembered a story in an old <i>Amulet</i>, one of
a series of annuals, bound in crimson cloth and fashionable at that
time, of a sailor stranded on a rock in the sea.&nbsp; The waves rose
to his lips, but he threw back his head, and at that moment there was
a pause and the tide turned.&nbsp; It might turn for her or it might
not; she must not move.&nbsp; She read scarcely any books and lived
much in the open air.&nbsp; The autumn was one of extraordinary splendour.&nbsp;
September rains after a dry summer washed the air and filled the tarns
and becks.&nbsp; Wherever she went she was accompanied by that most
delicious sound of falling waters.&nbsp; The clouds, which through July
and August had been nothing but undefined, barren vapour, gathered themselves
together and the interspaces of sky were once more brilliantly blue.&nbsp;
Day after day earth and heaven were almost too beautiful, for it was
painful that her finite apprehension should be unequal to such infinite
loveliness.&nbsp; She received no such answer as that for which she
hoped when she knelt by the grey rock, but that is the way with the
celestial powers; they reply to our passionate demands by putting them
aside and giving us that for which we did not ask.&nbsp; <i>We know
not how to pray as we ought.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>MR. WHITTAKER&rsquo;S RETIREMENT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I had been a partner in the house of Whittaker, Johnson, and Marsh,
in the wholesale drug trade, for twenty-five years, and, for the last
ten years, senior partner.&nbsp; For the first nine years of my seniority
I was not only nominally, but practically, the head of the firm.&nbsp;
I had ceased to occupy myself with details, but nothing of importance
was concluded without consulting me: I was the pivot on which the management
turned.&nbsp; In the tenth year, after a long illness, my wife died:
I was very ill myself, and for months not a paper was sent to me.&nbsp;
When I returned to work I found that the junior partners, who were pushing
men, had distributed between them what I was accustomed to do, and that
some changes which they thought to be indispensable had been made.&nbsp;
I resumed my duties as well as I could, but it was difficult to pick
up the dropped threads, and I was dependent for explanation upon my
subordinates.</p>
<p>Many transactions too, from a desire to avoid worrying me, were carried
through without my knowledge, although formerly, as a matter of course,
they would have been submitted to me.&nbsp; Strangers, when they called,
asked to see Johnson or Marsh.&nbsp; I directed the messenger that they
were to be shown into my room if I was disengaged.&nbsp; This was a
failure, for, when they came, I was obliged to ask for help, which was
not given very generously.&nbsp; Sometimes I sent for the papers, but
it took a long time to read them, and my visitors became impatient.&nbsp;
During one of these interviews, I remember that I was sorely perplexed,
but I had managed to say something loosely with no particular meaning.&nbsp;
Johnson came in and at once took up the case, argued for ten minutes
while I sat silent and helpless, and an arrangement was concluded in
which I really had no voice whatever.&nbsp; Now and then I strove to
assert myself by disapproval of suggestions offered to me, but in the
end was generally forced to admit I was wrong.&nbsp; We had a very large
order for which we were obliged to make special arrangements with manufacturers.&nbsp;
Both Johnson and Marsh were of opinion that a particular firm which
had often supplied us was not to be trusted, as our dealings with them
during my absence had been unsatisfactory.&nbsp; I was inclined foolishly
but naturally, to attach little importance to anything which had been
done entirely without me, ridiculed their objections, and forced my
decision upon them.&nbsp; The firm broke down; our contract with them
was cancelled; another had to be made under pressure, and we lost about
five hundred pounds.&nbsp; Although I was not reminded of my responsibility
in so many words, I knew that I was solely to blame; I became more than
ever convinced I was useless, and I was much dejected.&nbsp; At last
I made up my mind to retire.&nbsp; I was urged to remain, but not, as
I imagined, with any great earnestness, and on the 31st December 1856
I left the office in Eastcheap never to enter it again.</p>
<p>For the first two or three weeks I enjoyed my freedom, but when they
had passed I had had enough of it.&nbsp; <i>I had nothing to do</i>!&nbsp;
Every day at the hours when business was at its height, I thought of
the hurry, of the inquiries, of the people waiting in the anteroom,
of the ringing of bells, of the rapid instructions to clerks, of the
consultations after the letters were opened, of our anxious deliberations,
of the journeys to Scotland at an hour&rsquo;s notice, and of the interviews
with customers.&nbsp; I pictured to myself that all this still went
on, but went on without me, while I had no better occupation than to
unpack a parcel, pick the knots out of the string, and put it in a string-box.&nbsp;
I saw my happy neighbours drive off in the morning and return in the
evening.&nbsp; I envied them the haste, which I had so often cursed,
over breakfast.&nbsp; I envied them, while I took an hour over lunch,
the chop devoured in ten minutes; I envied them the weariness with which
they dragged themselves along their gravel-paths, half an hour late
for dinner.&nbsp; I was thrown almost entirely amongst women.&nbsp;
I had no children, but a niece thirty-five years old, devoted to evangelical
church affairs, kept house for me, and she had a multitude of female
acquaintances, two or three of whom called every afternoon.&nbsp; Sometimes,
to relieve my loneliness, I took afternoon tea, and almost invariably
saw the curate.&nbsp; I was the only man present.&nbsp; It was just
as if, being strong, healthy, and blessed with a good set of teeth,
I were being fed on water-gruel.&nbsp; The bird-wittedness, the absence
of resistance and of difficulty, were intolerable.&nbsp; The curate,
and occasionally the rector, tried to engage me, as I was a good subscriber,
in discussion on church affairs, but there seemed to me to be nothing
in these which required the force which was necessary for the commonest
day in the City.&nbsp; Mrs. Coleman and the rector were once talking
together most earnestly when I entered the room, and I instinctively
sat down beside them, but I found that the subject of their eager debate
was the allotment of stalls at a bazaar.&nbsp; They were really excited
- stirred I fully admit to their depths.&nbsp; I believe they were more
absorbed and anxious than I was on that never-to-be-forgotten morning
when Mortons and Nicholsons both failed, and for two hours it was just
a toss-up whether we should not go too.</p>
<p>I went with my niece one day to St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard to choose
a gown, but it was too much for me to be in a draper&rsquo;s shop when
the brokers&rsquo; drug sales were just beginning.&nbsp; I left my niece,
walked round the Churchyard as fast as I could, trying to make people
believe I was busy, and just as I came to Doctors Commons I stumbled
against Larkins, who used to travel for Jackman and Larkins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo, Whittaker!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;haven&rsquo;t seen
you since you left.&nbsp; Lucky dog!&nbsp; Wish I could do the same.&nbsp;
Ta-ta; can&rsquo;t stop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A year ago Mr. Larkins, with the most pressing engagement in front
of him, would have spared me just as much time as I liked to give him.</p>
<p>Formerly I woke up (sometimes, it is true, after a restless night)
with the feeling that before me lay a day of adventure.&nbsp; I did
not know what was in my letters, nor what might happen.&nbsp; Now, when
I rose I had nothing to anticipate but fifteen hours of monotony varied
only by my meals.&nbsp; My niece proposed that I should belong to a
club, but the members of clubs were not of my caste.&nbsp; I had taken
a pride in my garden and determined I would attend to it more myself.&nbsp;
I bought gardening books, but the gardener knew far more than I could
ever hope to know, and I could not displace him.&nbsp; I had been in
the habit of looking through a microscope in the evening, although I
did not understand any science in which the microscope is useful, and
my slides were bought ready-made.&nbsp; I brought it out now in the
daytime, but I was soon weary of it and sold it.&nbsp; We went to Worthing
for a month.&nbsp; We had what were called comfortable lodgings and
the weather was fine, but if I had been left to myself I should have
gone back to Stockwell directly my boxes were unpacked.&nbsp; We drove
eastwards as far as we could and then westward, and after that there
was nothing more to be done except to do the same thing over again.&nbsp;
At the end of the first week I could stand it no longer, and we returned.&nbsp;
I fancied my liver was out of order and consulted a physician.&nbsp;
He gave me some medicine and urged me to &lsquo;cultivate cheerful society,&rsquo;
and to take more exercise.&nbsp; I therefore tried long walks, and often
extended them beyond Croydon, and once as far as Reigate, but I had
never been accustomed to walking by myself, and as I knew the names
of scarcely half-a-dozen birds or trees, my excursions gave me no pleasure.&nbsp;
I have stood on Banstead Downs in the blaze of sunlight on a still October
morning, and when I saw the smoke-cloud black as night hang over the
horizon northwards, I have longed with the yearning of an imprisoned
convict to be the meanest of the blessed souls enveloped in it.</p>
<p>I determined at last to break up my household at Stockwell, to move
far away into the country; to breed fowls - an occupation which I was
assured was very profitable and very entertaining; dismiss my niece
and marry again.&nbsp; I began to consider which lady of those whom
I knew would suit me best, and I found one who was exactly the person
I wanted.&nbsp; She was about thirty-five years old, was cheerful, fond
of going out (I never was), a good housekeeper, played the piano fairly
well, and, as the daughter of a retired major in the Army, had a certain
air and manner which distinguished her from the wives and daughters
of our set and would secure for me an acquaintance with the country
gentlefolk, from which, without her, I should probably be debarred.&nbsp;
She had also told me when I mentioned my project to her, but saying
nothing about marriage, that she doted on fowls - they had such pretty
ways.&nbsp; As it was obviously prudent not to engage myself until I
knew more of her, I instigated my niece in a careless way to invite
her to stay a fortnight with us.&nbsp; She came, and once or twice I
was on the verge of saying something decisive to her, but I could not.&nbsp;
A strange terror of change in my way of life took hold upon me.&nbsp;
I should now have to be more at home, and although I might occupy myself
with the fowls during the morning and afternoon, the evening must be
spent in company, and I could not endure for more than half an hour
a drawing-room after dinner.&nbsp; There was another reason for hesitation.&nbsp;
I could see the lady would accept me if I proposed to her, but I was
not quite sure why.&nbsp; She would in all probability survive me, and
I fancied that her hope of survival might be her main reason for consenting.&nbsp;
I gave her up, but no sooner had she left us than I found myself impelled
to make an offer to a handsome girl of eight-and-twenty who I was ass
enough to dream might love me.&nbsp; I was happily saved by an accident
not worth relating, and although I afterwards dwelt much upon the charms
of two or three other ladies and settled with myself I would take one
of them, nothing came of my resolution.&nbsp; I was greatly distressed
by this growing indecision.&nbsp; It began to haunt me.&nbsp; If I made
up my mind to-day that I would do this or that, I always had on the
morrow twenty reasons for not doing it.&nbsp; I was never troubled with
this malady in Eastcheap.&nbsp; I was told that decay in the power of
willing was one of the symptoms of softening of the brain, and this
then was what was really the matter with me!&nbsp; It might last for
years!&nbsp; Wretched creature! my life was to be nothing better than
that of the horse in Bewick&rsquo;s terrible picture.&nbsp; I was &lsquo;waiting
for death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Part of my income was derived from interest on money lent to a cousin.&nbsp;
Without any warning I had a letter to say that he was bankrupt, and
that his estate would probably not pay eighteenpence in the pound.&nbsp;
It was quite clear that I must economise, and what to do and whither
to go was an insoluble problem to me.&nbsp; By chance I met an old City
acquaintance who told me of a &lsquo;good thing&rsquo; in Spanish bonds
which, when information was disclosed which he possessed, were certain
to rise twenty per cent.&nbsp; If what he said was true - and I had
no reason to doubt him - I could easily get back without much risk about
two-thirds of the money I had lost.&nbsp; Had I been in full work, I
do not believe I should have wasted a shilling on the speculation, but
the excitement attracted me, and I ventured a considerable sum.&nbsp;
In about a fortnight there was a sudden jump of two per cent. in my
securities, and I was so much elated that I determined to go farther.&nbsp;
I doubled my stake; in three weeks another rise was announced; I again
increased the investment, and now I watched the market with feverish
eagerness.&nbsp; One day I was downstairs a quarter of an hour earlier
than usual waiting for the boy who brought the paper.</p>
<p>I tore it open and to my horror saw that there was a panic on the
Stock Exchange; my bonds were worthless, and I was ruined.</p>
<p>I had always secretly feared that this would happen, and that I should
be so distracted as to lose my reason.&nbsp; To my surprise, I was never
more self-possessed, and I was not so miserable as might have been expected.&nbsp;
I at once gave notice of discharge to my servants, sold nearly all my
furniture and let my house.&nbsp; I was offered help, but declined it.&nbsp;
I moved into a little villa in one of the new roads then being made
at Brixton, and found that I possessed a capital which, placed in Consols
- for I would not trust anything but the public funds - brought me one
hundred and twenty-five pounds a year.&nbsp; This was not enough for
my niece, myself and a maid, and I was forced to consider whether I
could not obtain some employment.&nbsp; To return to Eastcheap was clearly
out of the question, but there was a possibility, although I was fifty-six,
that my experience might make me useful elsewhere.&nbsp; I therefore
called on Jackman and Larkins at twelve o&rsquo;clock, the hour at which
I knew there was a chance of finding them able to see me.&nbsp; During
my prosperity I always walked straight into their room marked &lsquo;private,&rsquo;
but now I went into the clerks&rsquo; office, took off my hat and modestly
inquired if either Mr. Jackman or Mr. Larkins could spare me a minute.&nbsp;
I was not asked to sit down - I, to whom these very clerks a little
over a twelvemonth ago would have risen when I entered; but my message
was taken, and I was told in reply that both Mr. Jackman and Mr. Larkins
were engaged.&nbsp; I was bold enough to send in another message and
was informed I might call in two hours&rsquo; time.&nbsp; I went out,
crossed London Bridge, and seeing the doors of St. Saviour&rsquo;s,
Southwark, open, rested there awhile.&nbsp; When I returned at the end
of two hours, I had to wait another ten minutes until a luncheon tray
came out.&nbsp; A bell then rang, which a clerk answered, and in about
five minutes, with a &lsquo;come this way&rsquo; I was ushered into
the presence of Jackman, who was reading the newspaper with a decanter
and a glass of sherry by his side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Whittaker, what brings you here?&nbsp; Ought to be looking
after your grapes at Stockwell - but I forgot; heard you&rsquo;d given
up grape-growing.&nbsp; Ah! odd thing, a man never retires, but he gets
into some mess; marries or dabbles on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
known lots of cases like yours.&nbsp; What can we do for you?&nbsp;
Times are horribly bad.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jackman evidently thought I was
going to borrow some money of him, and his tone altered when he found
I did not come on that errand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was very sorry - really I was, my dear fellow - to hear
of your loss, but it was a damned foolish thing to do, excuse me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Jackman,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have not lost all my
property, but I cannot quite live on what is left.&nbsp; Can you give
me some work?&nbsp; My connection and knowledge of your business may
be of some service.&rsquo;&nbsp; I had put hundreds of pounds in this
man&rsquo;s pocket, but forbore to urge this claim upon him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delighted, I am sure, if it were possible, but we have no
vacancy, and, to be quite plain with you, you are much too old.&nbsp;
We could get more out of a boy at ten shillings a week than we could
out of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jackman drank another glass of sherry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, sir&rsquo; - (sir! that I should ever call Tom Jackman
&lsquo;sir,&rsquo; but I did) - &lsquo;as I just said, my experience
and connection might be valuable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, as to experience, me and Larkins supply all that, and
the clerks do as they are told.&nbsp; Never keep a clerk more than two
years: he then begins to think he knows too much and wants more pay.&nbsp;
As to connection, pardon me - mean nothing, of course - but your recommendation
now wouldn&rsquo;t bring much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the door opened and Larkins entered in haste.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I say, Jackman - &rsquo; then turning and seeing me, - &lsquo;Hullo,
Whittaker, what the devil are you doing here?&nbsp; Jackman, I&rsquo;ve
just heard - &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Whittaker,&rsquo; said Jackman, &lsquo;sorry can&rsquo;t
help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neither of them offered to shake hands, and I passed out into the
street.&nbsp; The chop-houses were crammed; waiters were rushing hither
and thither; I looked up at the first floor of that very superior house,
used solely by principals, where I often had my lunch, and again crossed
London Bridge on my way back.&nbsp; London Bridge at half-past one!&nbsp;
I do not suppose I had ever been there at half-past one in my life.&nbsp;
I saw a crowd still passing both southwards and northwards.&nbsp; At
half-past nine it all went one way and at half-past six another.&nbsp;
It was the morning and evening crowd which was the people to me.&nbsp;
These half-past one o&rsquo;clock creatures were strange to me, loafers,
nondescripts.&nbsp; I was faint and sick when I reached home, for I
walked all the way, and after vainly trying to eat something went straight
to bed.&nbsp; But the next post brought me a note saying that Jackman
and Larkins were willing to engage me at a salary of &pound;100 a year
- much more, it was added, than they would have paid for more efficient
service, but conceded as a recognition of the past.&nbsp; The truth
was, as I afterwards found out, that Larkins persuaded Jackman that
it would increase their reputation to take old Whittaker.&nbsp; Larkins
too had become a little tired of soliciting orders, and I could act
as his substitute.&nbsp; I was known to nearly all the houses with which
they did business and very likely should gain admittance where a stranger
would be denied.&nbsp; My hours would be long, from nine till seven,
and must be observed rigidly.&nbsp; Instead of my three-and-sixpenny
lunch I should now have to take in my pocket whatever I wanted in the
middle of the day.&nbsp; For dinner I must substitute a supper - a meal
which did not suit me.&nbsp; I should have to associate with clerks,
to meet as a humble subordinate those with whom I was formerly intimate
as an equal; but all this was overlooked, and I was happy, happy as
I had not been for months.</p>
<p>It was on a Wednesday when I received my appointment, and on Monday
I was to begin.&nbsp; I said my prayers more fervently that night than
I had said them for years, and determined that, please God, I would
always go to church every Sunday morning no matter how fine it might
be.&nbsp; There were only three clear week-days, Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, to be got through.&nbsp; I imagined them to be holidays, although
I had never before taken three consecutive holidays, save in those wretched
Augusts or Septembers, when pride annually forced me away to the seaside.&nbsp;
At last Monday came: our breakfast hour was henceforth fixed at half-past
seven, and at eight o&rsquo;clock I started to walk to Kennington, and
thence to ride by an omnibus to King William&rsquo;s statue.&nbsp; Oh!
with what joy did I shut the little garden gate and march down the road,
once more somebody!&nbsp; I looked round, saw other little front gates
open, each by-street contributed, so that in the Kennington Road there
was almost a procession moving steadily and uniformly City-wards, and
<i>I</i> was in it.&nbsp; I was still a part of the great world; something
depended on me.&nbsp; Fifty-six? yes, but what was that?&nbsp; Many
men are at their best at fifty-six.&nbsp; So exhilarated was I, that
just before I mounted the omnibus - it was a cold morning, but I would
not ride inside - I treated myself to a twopenny cigar.&nbsp; My excitement
soon wore off.&nbsp; I could not so far forget myself as not to make
suggestions now and then, and Jackman took a delight in snubbing me.&nbsp;
It was a trial to me also to sit with the clerks.&nbsp; We had never
set ourselves up as grand people at Stockwell, but I had all my life
been accustomed to delicate food properly cooked, and now that my appetite
was declining with my years, I would almost at any time have gone without
a meal rather than eat anything that was coarse or dirtily served.&nbsp;
My colleagues ridiculed my &lsquo;Stockwell manners,&rsquo; as they
called them, and were very witty, so they thought, in their inquiries
when I produced my sandwich wrapped up in a clean napkin, how much it
cost me for my washing.&nbsp; They were a very cheap set, had black
finger-nails, and stuck their pens behind their ears.&nbsp; One of them
always brought a black-varnished canvas bag with him, not respectably
stiff like leather - a puckered, dejected-looking bag.&nbsp; It was
deposited in the washing place to be out of the way of the sun.&nbsp;
At one o&rsquo;clock it was brought out and emptied of its contents,
which were usually a cold chop and a piece of bread.&nbsp; A plate,
knife and fork, and some pepper and salt were produced from the desk,
and after the meat, which could be cut off from the chop, was devoured,
the bone was gnawed, wrapped up in paper, and put back in the bag.&nbsp;
The plate, knife, and fork were washed in the wash-hand basin and wiped
with the office jack-towel.&nbsp; It was hard when old business friends
called and I had to knock at the inner door and say, &lsquo;Mr. ---
wants to see you, sir,&rsquo; the object of the visit not being entrusted
to me.&nbsp; A few of them behaved politely to me, but to others it
seemed to be a pleasure to humble me.&nbsp; On that very first Monday,
Bullock, the junior in Wiggens, Moggs, and Bullock, burst into the room.&nbsp;
He knew me very well, but took no notice of me, although I was alone,
except to ask -</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mr. Jackman in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, can I do anything for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not deign to say a word, but went out, slamming the door behind
him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I kept up my spirits, or rather they kept themselves
up.&nbsp; At five o&rsquo;clock, when the scramble to get the letters
signed began, I thought of our street at home, so dull at that hour,
of the milkman, and the muffin-boy, of the curate, and of my niece&rsquo;s
companions, and reflected, thank God, that I was in the City, a man
amongst men.&nbsp; When seven o&rsquo;clock came and the gas was put
out, there was the anticipation also of the fight for a place in the
omnibus, especially if it was a wet night, and the certainty that I
should meet with one or two neighbours who would recognise me.&nbsp;
No more putting up window-blinds, pulling up weeds in the back garden,
sticking in seeds which never grew, or errands to suburban shops at
midday.&nbsp; How I used in my retirement to detest the sight of those
little shopkeepers when the doors of Glyn&rsquo;s Bank were swinging
to and fro!&nbsp; I came home dead-beaten now, it is true, but it was
a luxury to be dead-beaten, and I slept more soundly than I had ever
slept in my life.&nbsp; In about six months my position improved a little.&nbsp;
Jackman&rsquo;s love for sherry grew upon him, and once or twice, to
Larkins&rsquo;s disgust, his partner was not quite as fit to appear
in public as he ought to have been.&nbsp; Very often he was absent,
sick.&nbsp; Two of the cheap clerks also left in order to better themselves.&nbsp;
I never shall forget the afternoon - I felt as if I could have danced
for joy - when Larkins said to me, &lsquo;Whittaker, Mr. Jackman hasn&rsquo;t
very good health, and if he&rsquo;s not here when I am out, you must
answer anybody who calls, but don&rsquo;t commit yourself - and - let
me see - I was going to tell you you&rsquo;ll have ten pounds a year
more, beginning next quarter - and there was something else - Oh! I
recollect, if anybody should want to see Mr. Jackman when he happens
to be unwell here, and I am not with him, send for me if you know where
I am.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t know, you must do the best you can.&rsquo;&nbsp;
My office coat had hitherto been an old shiny, ragged thing, and I had
always taken off my shirt-cuffs when I began work, because they so soon
became dirty.&nbsp; I rammed the old coat that night into the fire;
brought my second-best coat in a brown paper parcel the next morning,
and wore my shirt-cuffs all day long.&nbsp; Continually I had to think
- only fancy, to think - once more; in a very small way, it is true,
but still to think and to act upon my thought, and when Larkins came
in and inquired if anybody had called, he now and then said &lsquo;all
right&rsquo; when I told him what I had done.&nbsp; A clerk from my
old office swaggered in and did not remove his hat.&nbsp; I descended
from my stool and put on my own hat.&nbsp; The next time he came he
was more polite.&nbsp; I have now had two years of it, and have not
been absent for a day.&nbsp; I hope I may go on till I drop.&nbsp; My
father died in a fit; his father died in a fit; and I myself often feel
giddy, and things go round for a few seconds.&nbsp; I should not care
to have a fit here, because there would be a fuss and a muddle, but
I should like, just when everything was <i>quite</i> straight, to be
able to get home safely and then go off.&nbsp; To lie in bed for weeks
and worry about my work is what I could not endure.</p>

<h2>CONFESSIONS OF A SELF-TORMENTOR</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>My father was a doctor in a country town.&nbsp; Strictly speaking
it was not a town, and yet it was something more than a village.&nbsp;
His practice extended over a district with a radius of five or six miles
from his house; he drove a gig and dispensed his own medicines.&nbsp;
My mother was the youngest daughter of a poor squire who owned two or
three hundred acres and lived at what was called the Park, which was
really nothing more than two or three fields generally laid for hay,
a small enclosure being reserved for a garden.&nbsp; We were not admitted
into county society, and my mother would not associate with farmers
and tradesfolk.&nbsp; She was a good woman, affectionate to her children
and husband, but never forgot that - so she thought - she had married
below her station.&nbsp; She had an uncle who had been in the Indian
Army, and his portrait in full regimentals hung in the dining-room.&nbsp;
How her heart warmed to the person who inquired who that officer was!&nbsp;
When she went home, it was never to her &lsquo;home,&rsquo; but to the
&lsquo;Park.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s income was not more than eight or nine hundred
a year, and his expenses were heavy, but nevertheless my mother determined
that I should go to the university, and I was accordingly sent to a
grammar school.&nbsp; I had not been there more than three years, and
was barely fourteen years old, when my father was pitched out of his
gig and killed.&nbsp; He had insured his life for two thousand pounds,
which was as much as he could afford, and my mother had another two
thousand pounds of her own.&nbsp; Her income therefore was less than
two hundred a year.&nbsp; She could not teach, she would not let lodgings,
nor was she wanted at the Park.&nbsp; She therefore took a cottage,
small but genteel, at a rental of ten pounds a year, and managed as
best she could.&nbsp; The furniture was partly sold, but the regimental
portrait was saved.&nbsp; Unhappily, as the cottage ceilings were very
low, it was not an easy task to hang it.&nbsp; The only place to be
found for it, out of the way of the chairs, was opposite the window,
in a parlour about twelve feet square, called the drawing-room; but
it was too long even there, and my great-uncle&rsquo;s legs descended
behind the sofa, and could not be seen unless it was moved.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
cottage is a shocking come-down,&rsquo; said my mother to the rector,
&lsquo;but it is not vulgar; it is at least a place in which a lady
can live.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course the university was now out of the question,
and at fifteen I left school.&nbsp; I had read a little Virgil, a little
Horace, and a book or two of Homer.&nbsp; I had also got through the
first six books of Euclid after a fashion, and had advanced as far as
quadratic equations in algebra, but had no mathematical talent whatever.&nbsp;
My mother would not hear of trade as an occupation for me, and she could
not afford to make me a soldier, sailor, doctor, lawyer, or parson.&nbsp;
At last the county member, at the request of her father, obtained for
me a clerkship in the Stamps and Taxes Department.&nbsp; These were
the days before competitive examinations.&nbsp; She was now able to
say that her son was in H. M. Civil Service.&nbsp; I had eighty pounds
a year, and lodged at Clapton with an aunt, my father&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>Although I had been only half-educated, I was fond of reading, and
I had plenty of time for it.&nbsp; I read good books, and read them
with enthusiasm.&nbsp; I was much taken with the Greek dramatists, especially
with Euripides, but my only means of access to them was through translations.&nbsp;
My aunt had another nephew who came to see her now and then.&nbsp; He
had obtained an open exhibition at Oxford, and one day I found that
he had a Greek Euripides in his pocket, and that he needed little help
from a dictionary.&nbsp; He sometimes brought with him a college friend,
and well do I remember a sneer from this gentleman about the poor creatures
whose acquaintance with &AElig;schylus was derived from Potter.&nbsp;
I did not look at a translation again for some time.</p>
<p>The men at my office were a curious set.&nbsp; The father of one
was a leader of the lowest blackguards in a small borough, who had much
to do with determining elections there; another bore the strongest resemblance
to a well-known peer; and another was the legitimate and perfectly scoundrel
offspring of a newspaper editor.&nbsp; I formed no friendships with
any of my colleagues, but one of them I greatly envied.&nbsp; He was
deaf and dumb, the son of a poor clergyman, and had an extraordinary
passion for botany.&nbsp; Every holiday was devoted to rambling about
the country near London.&nbsp; He cared little for anything but his
favourite science, but that he understood, and he never grew tired of
it.&nbsp; I took no account of his deafness and dumbness; the one thing
I saw was his mastership over a single subject.&nbsp; Gradually my incompleteness
came to weigh on me like a nightmare.&nbsp; I imagined that if I had
learned any craft which required skill, I should have been content.&nbsp;
I was depressed when I looked at the watchmaker examining my watch.&nbsp;
I should have walked the streets erect if there had been one thing which
I could do better than anybody I met.&nbsp; There was nothing: I stood
for nothing: no purpose was intended by God through me.&nbsp; I was
also constitutionally inaccurate - this was another of my troubles -
and nothing short of the daily use of a fact made me sure of it.&nbsp;
No matter how zealously I went over and over again a particular historical
period, I always broke down the moment my supposed acquisitions were
tested by questions or conversation.&nbsp; I have read a book with the
greatest attention I could muster, and have found, when I have seen
a simple examination paper on it, that I could not have got a dozen
marks.&nbsp; Of what value, then, were my notions on matters demanding
far greater concentration of thought?&nbsp; Accuracy I fancied might
be acquired, but I was mistaken.&nbsp; It is a gift as much as the art
of writing sublime poetry.&nbsp; I struggled and struggled with pencil
and pr&eacute;cis, but I did not improve.&nbsp; My cousin&rsquo;s before-mentioned
friend took delight in checking, like an accountant, what was said to
him, especially by me, and although I saw that this for the most part
was a mere trick, I could not deny that it proved continually that my
so-called opinions were not worth a straw.&nbsp; The related virtues
of accuracy, strength of memory, and clear definition, are of great
importance, but I over-estimated them.&nbsp; I see now that human affairs
are so complicated, that had I possessed the advantages bestowed on
my cousin and his companion, they would not have prevented delusions,
all the more perilous, perhaps, because I should have been more confident.&nbsp;
However, at the time of which I am speaking, I was wretched, and believed
that my wretchedness was entirely due to deficiencies and weaknesses,
from which my friends were free.&nbsp; No sorrow of genius is greater
than the daily misery of the man with no gifts, who is not properly
equipped, and has desires out of all proportion to his capacity.</p>
<p>I had no real love of art and did not understand it.&nbsp; I went
to concerts, but the only part of a sonata or symphony which took hold
of me was that which was melodious.&nbsp; The long passages with no
striking theme in them conveyed nothing to me, and as to Bach, excepting
now and then, his music was like a skilful recitation of nonsense verses.&nbsp;
The <i>Marseillaise</i> on a barrel-organ was intelligible, but gymnastics
on strings - what did they represent?&nbsp; With pictures the case was
somewhat different.&nbsp; I often left Clapton early in order that I
might have half an hour at Christie&rsquo;s in quiet, and I have spent
many pleasant moments in those rooms on sunny mornings in May and June
before De Wint&rsquo;s and Turner&rsquo;s landscapes.&nbsp; But I knew
nothing about them.&nbsp; Without previous instruction I should probably
have placed something worthless on the same level with them, and I could
not fix my attention on them long.&nbsp; A water-colour by Turner, on
which all his power had been expended, an abstract of years and years
of toil and observation, was unable to detain me for more than five
minutes, and in those five minutes I very likely did not detect one
of its really distinguishing qualities.&nbsp; As to the early religious
pictures of the Italian school, I cared nothing either for subject or
treatment, and would have given a cartload of them for a drawing by
Hunt of a bird&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; Wanting an ear for music and an eye
for pictorial merit, I believed, or affected to believe, that the raptures
of people who possessed the ear and eye were a sham.&nbsp; It irritated
me to hear my aunt play, although she had been well taught in her youth
and was a skilful performer.&nbsp; I know she would have liked to feel
that she gave me some pleasure, and that her playing was admired, but
I was so openly indifferent to it that at last she always shut the piano
if I happened to come into the room while she was practising.&nbsp;
I remember saying to her when she was talking to me about one of Mozart&rsquo;s
quartets she had just heard, that music was immoral, inasmuch as it
provoked such enormous insincerity.&nbsp; It is strange that, although
spite was painful to me, especially towards her, I could not help indulging
in it.</p>
<p>My failings gradually wrought in me confirmed bitterness.&nbsp; I
persuaded myself that the interest which people appeared to take in
me was mere polite pretence.&nbsp; There may be enough selfishness in
the world to explain misanthropy, but there is never enough to justify
it, and what we imagine to be indifference to us is often merely the
reserve caused by our own refusal to surrender ourselves to legitimate
and generous emotions.&nbsp; Oddly enough, I frequently made hasty and
spasmodic offers of intimate friendship to people who were not prepared
for them, and the natural absence of immediate response was a further
reason for scepticism.&nbsp; A man to whom I was suddenly impelled was
in want of money, and I pressed ten pounds upon him.&nbsp; He could
not pay me at the appointed time, whereupon I set him down as an ungrateful
brute, and moralised like Timon.</p>
<p>There was at that time living in London a lady whom I must call Mrs.
A.&nbsp; She was the widow of a professor at Cambridge who had died
young, and she might have been about five-and-thirty or forty years
old.&nbsp; My cousin, who had known her husband, introduced me to her.&nbsp;
She was not handsome; the cheek-bones were a little too prominent, and
her face was weather-worn, but not by wind and sun.&nbsp; Nevertheless
it was a quietly victorious face.&nbsp; Her ways were simple and refined.&nbsp;
She had travelled much, as far even as Athens, and was complete mistress
of Italian and French.&nbsp; Her voice struck me - it was so musical,
and adapted itself so delicately to varying shades of thought and emotion.&nbsp;
I have often reflected how little we get out of the voice in talking.&nbsp;
How delightful is the natural modulation which follows the sense, and
how much the sense gains if it is so expressed rather than in half-inarticulate
grunts, say, between the inspirations and expirations of a short pipe!</p>
<p>Mrs. A. took much notice of me, and her attitude towards me was singular.&nbsp;
She was not quite old enough to be motherly to me, but she was too old
for restrictions on her intercourse with me, and her wide experience
and wisdom well qualified her to be my directress.&nbsp; Often when
I went to her house nobody was there, and she would talk to me with
freedom on all sorts of subjects.&nbsp; I did not fall in love with
her, but she was still attractive as a woman, and difference of sex,
delightful manners, subtle intellect, expressive grey eyes, and lovely
black hair streaked with white, might have taught me much which I could
have learned from no ordinary friend.&nbsp; My cousin often went with
me to Mrs. A.&rsquo;s, but I was never at rest when he was there.&nbsp;
I fancied then that if I could have rendered a dozen lines of Gray&rsquo;s
<i>Elegy</i> into correct Greek, life would have nothing more to give
me.&nbsp; Mrs. A. was too well-behaved to encourage conversation in
my cousin&rsquo;s presence which disclosed my inferiority to him, but
without premeditation it sometimes turned where I could not follow.&nbsp;
As I have said, she had travelled in Greece.&nbsp; She understood something
of modern Greek, and she and my cousin one evening fell to comparing
it with ancient Greek.&nbsp; I sat sulky and dumb.&nbsp; At last she
turned to me, and asked me smilingly why I was so quiet.&nbsp; I replied
that I did not understand a word of what they were saying (which was
untrue), and that if they would talk about Stamps and Taxes I could
join.&nbsp; She divined in an instant what was the matter with me, and
diverted the discussion so that it might be within my reach.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
must confess,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that my knowledge of philology
is no better than yours.&nbsp; Philology demands the labour of a life.&nbsp;
I often wonder what the teacher, student, and school history of England
will be at the end of another thousand years.&nbsp; Perhaps, however,
in another thousand years books will no longer be written except on
physics.&nbsp; Men will say, &ldquo;What have we to do with the Wars
of the Roses?&rdquo; and as to general literature, they will become
weary of tossing over and over again the same old ideas and endeavouring
to imagine new variations of passion.&nbsp; The literary man will cease
from the land.&nbsp; Something of this sort must come to pass, unless
the human race is to be smothered.&rsquo;&nbsp; My cousin said he prayed
that her prophecy might come true, but I remained hard and stockish.&nbsp;
Her sweet temper, however, could not be disturbed, and she announced
that she was going to see Rachel, the great actress, and invited us
both to accompany her.&nbsp; I refused, on the ground that I knew nothing
of French (also untrue).&nbsp; She assured me that if I would read the
play beforehand I should be in no difficulty.&nbsp; I was really touched
by her kindness, but the devil in me would not let me yield.&nbsp; I
missed the opportunity of seeing Rachel, just as I missed many other
opportunities of more importance.&nbsp; Oh! when I look back now over
my life and call to mind what I might have had simply for taking and
did not take, my heart is like to break.&nbsp; The curse for me has
not been plucking forbidden fruit, but the refusal of divine fruit offered
me by heavenly angels.</p>
<p>Mrs. A.&rsquo;s circle of acquaintances widened during the two or
three years of my friendship with her.&nbsp; She often pressed me to
meet them, but I nearly always held back.&nbsp; I told her that I did
not care for mere acquaintances, and that certainly not more than one
or two of her visitors would shed a tear if they heard she was dead.&nbsp;
&lsquo;To possess one or two friends,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;who would
weep at my departure would be quite enough.&nbsp; It is as much as anybody
ought to demand, but you are mistaken in supposing that those who would
not break their hearts for us may not be of value, and even precious.&nbsp;
We are so made that the attraction which unites us to our fellow-creatures
is, and ought to be, of varying intensity, and there is something to
be obtained from a weaker bond which is not to be had from a stronger.&nbsp;
I like the society of Mrs. Arnold and Madame Sorel.&nbsp; I enjoy the
courtesy which is not slipper-and-dressing-gown familiarity, and their
way of looking at things, especially Madame Sorel&rsquo;s, is different
from mine and instructs me.&nbsp; Forgive me for reminding you that
in our Father&rsquo;s house are many mansions, and if we wish to be
admitted to some of them we must wear our best clothes, and when we
are inside we must put on our company manners.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was
quite right; Mrs. Arnold and Madame Sorel could have given me just what
I needed.</p>
<p>My visits to Mrs. A. became less and less frequent, and at last altogether
ceased.&nbsp; It was actually painful to me to neglect her, but I forced
myself to it, or to put it more correctly the Demon of pure Malignity,
for there is such a demon in Hell, drove me to it.</p>
<p>Some years afterwards I wrote to her asking her if she could get
work for a starving man whom she had known in other days, and she helped
him to obtain it.&nbsp; Two years after she had done this kind office,
and had shown she had not forgotten me, she died, and I went to her
funeral in Brompton Cemetery.&nbsp; It was a cold day, and black fog
hung over London.&nbsp; When the coffin was lowered into the grave I
wept many tears.&nbsp; I had been guilty of a neglect which was wicked
injustice, and I could never hear her say she had forgiven me.&nbsp;
I understood the meaning of atonement, and why it has been felt in all
ages that, by itself, reformation is insufficient.&nbsp; I attempted
an expiation, which I need not describe.&nbsp; It is painful, but the
sacrifice which I trust I shall offer to the end of my days brings me
a measure of relief.</p>
<p>About a twelvemonth after Mrs. A.&rsquo;s death I fell sick with
inflammation of the lungs.&nbsp; Once before, when I was ill, I declined
my aunt&rsquo;s attendance.&nbsp; I said that I did not believe it was
possible for mere friendship or affection to hold out against long watching,
and that there must come a time when the watcher would be relieved by
the death of the patient.&nbsp; I declared that nothing was more intolerable
to me than to know that anybody sacrificed the least trifle on my behalf,
and that if my aunt really wished me to get better she would at once
send for a paid nurse.&nbsp; I had a paid nurse, but Alice, our servant,
told me afterwards that my poor aunt cried a good deal when she saw
her place taken by a stranger.&nbsp; She was now nearly seventy, but
she offered herself again, and I thankfully accepted her, stipulating
of course that she should be helped.&nbsp; I wondered how she could
retain her love for me, how she could kiss me so tenderly morning and
night, and apparently not remember my unkindness to her.&nbsp; But therein
lies the difference between a man and a woman.&nbsp; Woman is Christian.&nbsp;
A woman&rsquo;s love will sweep like a river in flood over a wrong which
has been done to it and bury it for ever.</p>
<p>I am not regenerate, but who is ever regenerate?&nbsp; My insignificance
and defects do not worry me as they did: I do not kick at them, and
I am no longer covetous of other people&rsquo;s talents and virtues.&nbsp;
I am grateful for affection, for kindness, and even for politeness.&nbsp;
What a tremendous price do we have to pay for what we so slowly learn,
and learn so late!</p>

<h2>A LETTER TO THE &lsquo;RAMBLER&rsquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Sent to the <i>Rambler</i> March 1752, but, alas, in that month the
<i>Rambler</i> came to an end.&nbsp; I am not sorry it was not printed.&nbsp;
On re-reading it I find passages here and there which are unconscious
and unavoidable imitations of Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; No use in re-writing
them now.</p>
<p>J. R.<br /><i>June</i> 1760.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Sir, - I venture to send you a part of the history of my life, trusting
that my example may be a warning against confidence in our own strength
to resist even the meanest temptation.</p>
<p>My father was a prosperous haberdasher in Cheapside, and I was his
eldest son.&nbsp; My mother was the daughter of the clerk to the Fellmongers&rsquo;
Company.&nbsp; She had reached the mature age of nine-and-twenty when
she received an offer of matrimony from my father, and after much anxious
consideration and much consultation with her parents, prudently decided
to accept it, although to the end of her days she did not scruple openly
to declare that she had lowered herself by marrying a man who was compelled
to bow behind a counter to the wife of a grocer, and stand bareheaded
at the carriage door of an alderman&rsquo;s lady.&nbsp; My mother, I
am sorry to say, abetted my natural aversion from trade and sent me
to Saint Paul&rsquo;s School to learn Latin, Greek, and the mathematicks
that I might be qualified to separate myself from the class to which
unhappily she was degraded and that she might recover in her child the
pride she had lost in her husband.&nbsp; My abilities were not despicable,
my ambition was restless, and my progress in my studies was therefore
respectable.&nbsp; I conceived a genuine admiration for the classick
authors; I was genuinely moved by the majesty of Homer and the felicity
of expression in Horace.&nbsp; In due time I went to Oxford, and after
the usual course there, in which I was not unsuccessful, I took Holy
Orders and became a curate.&nbsp; When I was about eight-and-twenty
I was presented with a College living in the village of A. about four
miles from the county town of B. in the West of England.&nbsp; My parishioners
were the squire, a half-pay captain in the army, a retired custom-house
surveyor who was supposed to be the illegitimate son of a member of
parliament, and the surrounding farmers and labourers.&nbsp; All were
grossly illiterate, but I soon observed that a common ignorance does
not prevent, but rather tends to establish artificial distinctions.&nbsp;
Inferiority by a single degree in the social scale becomes not only
a barrier to intercourse, but a sufficient reason for contempt.&nbsp;
The squire and his lady spent their days in vain attempts to secure
invitations to my Lord&rsquo;s at the Abbey and revenged themselves
by patronising the captain, who in his turn nodded to the surveyor but
would on no account permit intimacy.&nbsp; The surveyor could not for
his life have condescended to enter a farmhouse, and yet was never weary
of denouncing as intolerably stuck-up the behaviour of those above him.&nbsp;
He consoled himself by the reflection that they were the losers, and
that, poor creatures, their neglect of him was due to a lamentable misapprehension
of the dignity of H. M. Custom-house Service.&nbsp; I can assure you
I thought the comedy played at A. very ridiculous, and often laughed
at it.</p>
<p>It was soon quite clear to me that if I was to live in peace I must
take to myself a wife.&nbsp; The squire and the surveyor had daughters.&nbsp;
The squire&rsquo;s would each have a hundred a-year apiece, a welcome
addition to my small income.&nbsp; They were good-looking, and by repute
were virtuous and easy of temper, but when I became acquainted with
them I found that I must not expect from them any entertainment save
the description of visits to the milliner, or schemes for parties, or
the gossip of the country-side.&nbsp; I did not demand, <i>Mr. Rambler</i>,
the critical acumen of Mrs. Montagu, or the erudition of Mrs. Carter,
but I believe you will agree with me that a wife, and especially the
wife of a clergyman and a scholar, should be able to read a page of
Dr. Barrow&rsquo;s sermons without yawning, and should not drop Mr.
Pope&rsquo;s <i>Iliad</i> or <i>Odyssey</i> in five minutes unless she
happened to light upon some particularly exciting adventure.&nbsp; I
therefore dismissed the thought of these young ladies, and the daughters
of the surveyor were for the same reasons ineligible, with the added
objection that if I chose one of them the squire and his family would
never enter the church again.</p>
<p>One day I went over to B. to leave my watch for repairs.&nbsp; I
noticed a fishing-rod in the shop, and as I was fond of the sport I
asked the watchmaker if it was his.&nbsp; He said that he generally
went fishing when he could spare himself a holiday, and that he had
just spent two days on the Avon.&nbsp; I was thinking of the Stratford
river and foolishly inquired which Avon, forgetting the one near us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our Avon,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;our Avon, of course, sir;
<i>the</i> Avon.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Proud of his adamants with which he shines<br />And
glisters wide, as als of wondrous Bath.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I did not recollect the lines, but discovered on inquiry that they
were Spenser&rsquo;s, an author, I regret to say, whom I had not read.&nbsp;
I was astonished that a person with a mechanical occupation who sat
in a window from morning to night dissecting time-pieces should be acquainted
with poetry, and I begged him to tell me something of his life.&nbsp;
He was the son of a bookseller in Bristol who had been apprenticed to
the celebrated Mr. Bernard Lintot.&nbsp; The father failed in business,
and soon afterwards died leaving a widow and six children.&nbsp; My
friend was then about fourteen years old.&nbsp; He had been well educated,
but his mother was compelled to accept the offer of a neighbour who
took compassion on her, and he was brought up to the watchmaking trade
in Bath.&nbsp; He had to work long hours and endure many hardships which
it might be supposed would tend to repress the sallies of the most lively
imagination, but some men are so constituted that adverse circumstances
do but stimulate a search for compensation.&nbsp; So it was with him.&nbsp;
In his leisure hours he studied not only horological science but the
works of our great English authors.</p>
<p>I was so much attracted to the watchmaker that I often called on
him, when I had no business with him.&nbsp; He had a wife and daughter,
both of whom were his companions.&nbsp; Melissa, the daughter, was about
nineteen.&nbsp; She was not beautiful according to the Grecian model,
but her figure was elegant, there was depth in her eyes, and she was
always dressed with simplicity and taste.&nbsp; She spoke correctly,
and surprised me by the justness of her observations, not merely on
local and personal matters, but upon subjects with which women of more
exalted rank are not usually familiar.&nbsp; Admission had been refused
to her by every school in Bath, but she had been taken in charge by
two elderly gentlewomen, distant relations of her grandfather, who had
instructed her in the usual branches of polite learning, including French.&nbsp;
I will content myself, <i>Mr. Rambler</i>, with informing you that I
fell in love with Melissa, and that she did not discourage my attentions.&nbsp;
I had not altogether overlooked the possibility of embarrassment at
A., but my passion prevented the clear foresight of consequences.&nbsp;
I have often found that evils which are imaginary will press upon me
with singular vivacity, while those which may with certainty be deduced
from any action are but obscurely apprehended, so that in fact intensity
of colour is an indication of unreality.&nbsp; I must add that if the
future had presented itself to me with prophetic distinctness, my love
for Melissa was so great that I should not have hesitated.&nbsp; My
frequent visits to B. had not passed unnoticed at A., and the reason
was suspected.&nbsp; Hints were not wanting, and the custom-house surveyor
told me a harrowing tale of a fellow-surveyor who had alienated all
his friends and had been obliged to leave his house near Tower Hill
because he had chosen to marry the daughter of a poor author who lived
in Whitefriars.&nbsp; One day early in the morning I was in B. and met
the squire&rsquo;s young ladies with their mother.&nbsp; She was a very
proud dame.&nbsp; Her maiden name was Bone, and her father had been
a sugar-baker in Bristol, but this was not a retail trade, and she had
often told me that she was descended from Geoffrey de Bohun, who was
in the retinue of William the Conqueror and killed five Saxons with
his own hand at the battle of Hastings.&nbsp; Her children, she bade
me observe, had inherited the true Bohun ears as shown in an engraving
she possessed of a Bohun tomb in Normandy.&nbsp; I walked with the party
up the High Street, and had not gone far when I saw Melissa coining
towards us.&nbsp; O, <i>Mr. Rambler</i>, can I utter it!&nbsp; She approached
us, she knew that I must have recognised her, but I turned my head towards
a shop-window and called my companions&rsquo; attention to the display
of silks and satins.&nbsp; After Melissa had passed, my lady asked me
if that was not the watchmaker&rsquo;s daughter and whether I knew anything
about her.&nbsp; I replied that I believed it was, and that I had heard
she was a respectable young woman.&nbsp; My lady remarked that she had
understood that she was virtuous, but that she had been unbecomingly
brought up, and considered herself superior to her position.&nbsp; Her
ladyship confessed that she would not be surprised any day to hear that
Miss --- - had been obliged to leave B., for she had noticed that when
a female belonging to the lower orders strove to acquire knowledge unsuitable
to her station, the consequence was often ruin.&nbsp; It is almost incredible
- I was silent! - but when I reached home I was overcome with shame
and despair.&nbsp; This then was all that my love was worth; this was
my esteem for intelligence and learning; and I was the man who had thanked
God I was not as my neighbours at A.!&nbsp; If in the beginning I had
deliberately resolved that it would be a mistake to ally myself with
Melissa&rsquo;s family because my usefulness might be diminished, something
might have been pleaded on my behalf, but I was without excuse.&nbsp;
I had sacrificed Melissa to no principle, but to detestable vulgar cowardice.&nbsp;
It was about two hours after noon when I returned, and in my confusion
a note from Melissa which lay upon my table was not at once noticed.&nbsp;
It had been written the day before, and it tenderly upbraided me because
I had been absent for a whole week.&nbsp; Enclosed was a copy of verses
by Sir Philip Sidney beginning, &lsquo;My true love hath my heart.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I mounted my horse again, and in less than half an hour was in B.&nbsp;
I flew to Melissa.&nbsp; She received me in silence, but without rebuke.&nbsp;
Indeed, before she had time for a word, I had knelt at her feet and
had covered my face with her hands.&nbsp; On my way through the town
I had seen my lady with her children, and one or two fashionably-dressed
women, friends who lived in B.&nbsp; My lady was completing her purchases.&nbsp;
I implored Melissa immediately to come out with me.&nbsp; She was astonished
and hesitated, but my impetuosity was so urgent that she feared to refuse,
and without any explanation I almost dragged her into the street.&nbsp;
On the opposite side I descried my lady and her party.&nbsp; I crossed
over, took Melissa&rsquo;s arm in mine, came close to them face to face,
bowed, and then passed on.&nbsp; We then recrossed the road and turned
into Melissa&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I looked back and saw that they were
standing still, stricken with astonishment.&nbsp; We went into the little
parlour: nobody was there.&nbsp; Melissa threw her arms round my neck,
and happier tears were never shed.&nbsp; In all the long years which
have now gone by since that memorable day I have never had to endure
from that divine creature a word or a hint which even the suspicion
of wounded self-respect could interpret as a reproach.</p>
<p>We were married at B.&nbsp; The custom-house surveyor never entered
his parish church again, but went over to B. once every Sunday.&nbsp;
He wrote me a letter to say that it was with much regret that he left
the church of his own village, but that it was no longer possible to
derive any edification from the services there.&nbsp; The captain remained,
but discontinued his civilities.&nbsp; The squire informed me that as
I was still a priest and possessed authority to administer the holy
sacraments he should continue his attendance, but that of course all
personal intercourse must cease.&nbsp; I expected that the common people
would have been confirmed in their attachment to me, but the opinion
of the little village butcher was that I had disgraced myself, and the
farmers and labourers would not even touch their hats to my wife when
they met her.&nbsp; However, we did not care, and in time it was impossible
even to the squire not to recognise her tact, manners, and sense.&nbsp;
Her father had constructed an ingenious sun-dial which he had placed
on the front of his shop.&nbsp; The great Mr. Halley was staying with
Mr. M., who lives about five miles from B., and seeing the dial when
he was in the town, called on my father-in-law, and was so much struck
with him that he obtained permission to invite him to dinner.&nbsp;
There the squire met him and was obliged to sit opposite him, amazed
to hear him converse on equal terms with Mr. Halley and his host, and
to discover that he knew how to behave with decency.&nbsp; Hostility
continued to wear away.&nbsp; Few people are endowed with sufficient
perseverance to continue a quarrel unless the cause is constantly renewed.</p>
<p>My betrayal of Melissa has not been altogether without profit.&nbsp;
I had imagined myself morally superior to my parishioners, and if I
had put the question to myself I should have said with confidence that
it was impossible that there should exist in me a weakness I had never
suspected, one which every day moved me to laughter or to scorn.&nbsp;
But, sir, I now feel how true it is that in our immortal poet&rsquo;s
words, &lsquo;Man, proud man, is most ignorant of what he&rsquo;s most
assured, his glassy essence.&rsquo;&nbsp; I hope you will pardon a reference
to sacred history: I understand how the Apostle Peter came to deny his
Lord.&nbsp; A few minutes before the dreadful crime was committed he
would have considered himself as incapable of it as he was of the sale
of his Master for money or of that damning kiss, and a few minutes afterwards
he would have suffered death for His sake.&nbsp; This, <i>Mr. Rambler</i>,
is the lesson which induced me to write to you.&nbsp; Let him that thinketh
he standeth take heed lest he fall; and indeed he may take all heed
and yet will fall, unless Divine Providence mercifully catches him and
holds him up.</p>

<h2>A LETTER FROM THE AUTHORESS OF &lsquo;JUDITH CROWHURST&rsquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>You have asked me to tell you all about <i>Judith Crowhurst</i>.&nbsp;
I will tell you something more and begin at the beginning.&nbsp; You
will remember that Miss Hardman said to Mrs. Pryor, Mrs. Hardman&rsquo;s
governess: &lsquo;WE need the imprudences, extravagances, mistakes and
crimes of a certain number of fathers to sow the seed from which WE
reap the harvest of governesses.&nbsp; The daughters of tradespeople,
however well educated, must necessarily be under-bred, and as such unfit
to be inmates of OUR dwellings, or guardians of OUR children&rsquo;s
minds and persons.&nbsp; WE shall ever prefer to place those about OUR
offspring, who have been born and bred with somewhat of the same refinement
as OURSELVES.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was one of those unhappy women who, mercifully
for the upper classes, inherit manners and misery in order that the
children of these superior creatures may not put an &lsquo;r&rsquo;
at the end of &lsquo;idea&rsquo; and may learn how to sit down in a
chair with propriety.&nbsp; My father was a clergyman holding a small
country living.&nbsp; He died when I was five-and-twenty, and I had
to teach in order to earn my bread.&nbsp; I obtained a tolerably good
situation, but at the end of two years I was informed that, although
a clergyman&rsquo;s daughter would &lsquo;do very well&rsquo; so long
as her pupils were quite young, it was now time that they should be
handed over to a lady who had been accustomed to Society.&nbsp; I had
become thoroughly weary of my work.&nbsp; I was not enthusiastic to
instruct girls for whom I did not care.&nbsp; I suppose that if I had
been a born teacher, I should have been as happy with the little Hardmans
as I was in the nursery with my youngest sister now dead.&nbsp; I should
not have said to myself, as I did every morning, &lsquo;What does it
matter?&rsquo;&nbsp; In my leisure moments and holidays during those
two years I had written a novel.&nbsp; I could supply conversation and
description, but it was very difficult to invent a plot, and still more
difficult to invent one which of itself would speak.&nbsp; I had collected
a quantity of matter of all kinds before I began, and then I cast about
for a frame in which to fit it.&nbsp; At last I settled that my hero,
if hero he could be called, should fall in love with a poor but intelligent
and educated girl.&nbsp; He had a fortune of about two thousand pounds
a year, nearly the whole of which he lost through the defalcations of
a brother, whose creditors received about five shillings in the pound.&nbsp;
He felt that the fair name of his family was stained, and he was consumed
with a passion to repay his brother&rsquo;s debts and to recover possession
of the old house and land which had been sold.&nbsp; He went abroad,
worked hard, and met with a lady who was rich whom he really admired.&nbsp;
His love for his betrothed had been weakened by absence, the engagement,
for some trifling reason, was broken off, and he married the heiress.&nbsp;
At the end of five years he returned to England, discharged every liability,
and in two years more was the owner of his birthplace.&nbsp; The marriage,
alas! was unhappy.&nbsp; There was no obtrusive fault in his wife, but
he did not love her.&nbsp; She could not understand his resolution to
take upon himself his brother&rsquo;s debts, and she thought the price
he paid for the house was excessive, as indeed it was.&nbsp; She was
a good manager, but without imagination.&nbsp; He was rejoicing, in
her presence, one spring morning that he had been wakened by the clamour
of the rooks with which he had been familiar ever since he was a boy,
and her reply was that an estate equal in value to his own and possessing
a bigger rookery had been offered him for less money by one-third than
he had thrown away.&nbsp; Unfortunately it is not in management or morality
that we crave companionship.&nbsp; It is in religion and in the deepest
emotions that we thirst for it.&nbsp; Gradually he became wretched,
and life was almost unbearable.&nbsp; She took no pleasure in the ancient
place and its beautiful garden, he never asked her to admire them, and
there was neither son nor daughter to inherit his pious regard.&nbsp;
At this point I was obliged to introduce the <i>Deus ex machina</i>,
and the wife died.&nbsp; The widower sought out his first love; she
had never wavered in her affection to him; they were married, had children,
and were happy.</p>
<p>My tale was a youthful blunder.&nbsp; It was not really a tale.&nbsp;
I introduced, in order to provide interest, all sorts of accessories
- aunts, parsons, gamekeepers, nurses, a fire and some hairbreadth escapes,
but they were none of them essential and they were all manufactured.&nbsp;
The only parts not worthless were those which were autobiographical.</p>
<p>One of them I remember very well, although my MS. was burnt long
ago.&nbsp; I believed then that Nature is not merely beautiful, but
that she can speak words which we can hear if we listen devoutly, and
that if personality has any meaning she is personal,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;The guide, the guardian of the heart and soul.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Towards the end of an autumn afternoon I had rambled up to the pillar
which was a landmark to seven counties.&nbsp; It was wet during the
morning, but at five o&rsquo;clock the rain ceased and a long, irregular
line of ragged cloud, dripping here and there, stretched itself above
the opposite hills from east to west.&nbsp; Underneath it was a border
of pale-golden, open sky, and below was the sea.&nbsp; The hills hid
it, but I knew it was there.&nbsp; I was hushed and reassured.&nbsp;
When I got home I transferred my emotion to my deserted heroine, and
tears blotted the paper.&nbsp; But it was a mere episode, without connection
and, in fact, an obstruction.</p>
<p>I sent my manuscript to a publisher and need hardly say that it was
returned as unsuitable.&nbsp; I tried two others, but with no success.&nbsp;
The third enclosed a copy of his reader&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; Here
it is:-</p>
<p>&lsquo; . . . is obviously a first attempt.&nbsp; It evinces some
power in passages, but the characters lack distinction and are limited
by ordinary conventional rules.&nbsp; I cannot recommend it to you for
its own sake, and there is no prospect in it of anything better.&nbsp;
The author might be capable of short stories for a religious magazine.&nbsp;
It is singular that Miss C.&rsquo;s <i>Mariana</i>, which you also sent
me, should be on somewhat the same lines, but Mariana, his first love,
is seduced by the man who forsakes her and, in the end, marries her
as his second wife.&nbsp; During his first marriage his intimacy with
Mariana continues and Miss C. thereby has an opportunity, which she
used with much power, for realistic scenes, that I believe will prove
attractive.&nbsp; I had no hesitation therefore in advising you to purchase
<i>Mariana</i>, although the plot is crude.&rsquo;&nbsp; I could not
take the publisher&rsquo;s hint.&nbsp; I put my papers back into my
box and obtained another situation.&nbsp; In about a twelvemonth, notwithstanding
my disappointment, I was unable to restrain myself from trying again.&nbsp;
I fancied that I might be able to project myself into actual history
and appropriate it.&nbsp; I had been much attracted to Mary Tudor, and
I had studied everything about her on which I could lay my hands.&nbsp;
I did not love her, but I pitied her profoundly, and the Holbein portrait
of her seemed to me to indicate a terrible and pathetic secret.&nbsp;
I cannot, however, give a complete explanation of her fascination for
me.&nbsp; It is impossible to account for the resistless magnetism with
which one human being draws another.&nbsp; The elements are too various
and are compounded with too much subtlety.&nbsp; Bitter Roman Catholic
as Mary was, I wished I could have been one of the ladies of her court,
that I might have offered my heart to her and might have wept with her
in her sorrow.&nbsp; But my intense feeling for a picture of the Queen
was no qualification to paint the original, and although I strove to
keep close to facts she insensibly became myself.&nbsp; I was altogether
stopped when I happened to meet with Aubrey de Vere&rsquo;s <i>Mary
Tudor</i> and Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Queen Mary.</i></p>
<p>Soon afterwards I read <i>Jane Eyre</i> again, and was more than
ever astonished at it.&nbsp; It is not to be classed; it is written
not by a limited human personality but by Nature herself.&nbsp; The
love in it is too great for creatures who are &lsquo;even as the generations
of leaves&rsquo;; the existence of two mortals does not account for
it.&nbsp; There is an irresistible sweep in it like that of the Atlantic
Ocean in a winter&rsquo;s storm hurling itself over the western rocks
of Scilly.&nbsp; I do not wonder that people were afraid of the book
and that it was cursed.&nbsp; The orthodox daughter of a country parson
broke conventional withes as if they were cobwebs.&nbsp; <i>Jane Eyre</i>
is not gross in a single word, but its freedom is more complete than
that of a licentious modern novel.&nbsp; Do you recollect St. John Rivers
says to Jane: &lsquo;Try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with
which you throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour
for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite, transient objects.&nbsp;
Do you hear, Jane?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She replies - &lsquo;Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.&nbsp;
I feel I have adequate cause to be happy, and I <i>will</i> be happy.&nbsp;
Good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therein speaks the worshipper of the Sun.&nbsp; Do you also recollect
that voice in the night from Rochester?&nbsp; She breaks from St. John,
goes up to her bedroom and prays.&nbsp; &lsquo;In my way - a different
way to St. John&rsquo;s, but effective in its own fashion.&nbsp; I seemed
to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude
at His feet.&nbsp; I rose from the thanksgiving - took a resolve - and
lay down, unscared, enlightened - eager but for the daylight.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Mighty Spirit, who was Jane Eyre&rsquo;s God, had directed her not
to go to India as St. John&rsquo;s bride to save souls from damnation
by conversion to Jehovah, but to set off that very day to Rochester
at Thornfield Hall.</p>
<p>Consider also how inseparably the important incidents in <i>Jane
Eyre</i> are linked with one another and with character.&nbsp; Jane
refused Rochester at first and St. John finally.&nbsp; She could not
possibly do otherwise.&nbsp; But I must stop.&nbsp; You did not ask
for an essay on Charlotte Bronte.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that when
I had finished <i>Jane Eyre</i> I said to myself that I would not write
any more.&nbsp; Nor did I ever attempt fiction again.&nbsp; <i>Judith
Crowhurst</i> is a plain, true story, altered a little in order to prevent
recognition.&nbsp; I knew her well.&nbsp; There is no suffering in any
stage tragedy equal to that of the unmarried woman who is well brought
up, with natural gifts above those of women generally, living on a small
income, past middle-age, and unable to work.&nbsp; It is not the suffering
which is acute torture ending in death, but worse, the black, moveless
gloom of the second floor in Hackney or Islington.&nbsp; Almost certainly
she has but few friends, and those she has will be occupied with household
or wage-earning duties.&nbsp; She is afraid of taking up their time;
she never calls without an excuse.&nbsp; What is she to do?&nbsp; She
cannot read all day, and, if she could, what is the use of reading?&nbsp;
Poets and philosophers do not touch her case; descriptions of moonlit
seas, mountains, moors, and waterfalls darken by contrast the view of
the tiles and chimneys from her own window.&nbsp; Ideas do not animate
or interest her, for she never has a chance of expressing them and,
lacking expression, they are indistinct.&nbsp; Her eyes wander down
page after page of her book, but she is only half-conscious.&nbsp; Religion,
such as it is now, gives no help.&nbsp; It is based on the necessity
of forgiveness for some wrong done and on the notion of future salvation.&nbsp;
She needs no forgiveness unless she takes upon herself a burden of artificial
guilt.&nbsp; She rather feels she has to forgive - whom or what she
does not know.&nbsp; The heaven of the churches and chapels is remote,
unprovable, and cannot affect her in the smallest degree.&nbsp; There
is no religion for her and such as she, excepting that Catholic Faith
of one article only - <i>The</i> <i>clods of the valley shall be sweet
unto him</i>.&nbsp; As I have said, I knew Judith Crowhurst well, and
after she was dead I wrote her biography, because I believed there are
thousands like her in London alone.&nbsp; I hoped that here and there
I might excite sympathy with them.&nbsp; We sympathise when we sit in
a theatre overpowered by stage agony, but a truer sympathy is that which
may require some effort, pity for common, dull, and deadly trouble that
does not break out in shrieks and is not provided with metre and scenery.</p>
<p>You were kind enough to get <i>Judith Crowhurst</i> published for
me, and it has had what is called a &lsquo;success,&rsquo; but I doubt
if it will do any good.&nbsp; People devour books but, when they have
finished one, they never ask themselves what is to be done.&nbsp; It
is immediately followed by another on a different subject, and reading
becomes nothing but a pastime or a narcotic.&nbsp; <i>Judith</i> may
be admired, but it is by those who will not undergo the fatigue of a
penny journey in an omnibus to see their own Judith, perhaps nearly
related to them, and will excuse themselves because she is not entertaining.</p>
<p>I was asked the other day if I was not proud of some of the reviews.&nbsp;
Good God!&nbsp; I would rather have been Alice Ayres, <a name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148">{148}</a>
and have died as she died, than have been famous as the author of the
<i>Divine Comedy, Paradise Lost</i>, or <i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; She is
now forgotten and sleeps in an obscure grave in some London cemetery.&nbsp;
No! there will be nothing more.&nbsp; I have said all I had to say.</p>

<h2>CLEARING-UP AFTER A STORM IN JANUARY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A westerly storm of great strength had been blowing all day, shaking
the walls of the house and making us fear for the chimneys.&nbsp; About
four o&rsquo;clock, although the wind continued very high, the clouds
broke, and moved in a slow, majestic procession obliquely from the north-west
to the south-east.&nbsp; Here and there small apertures revealed the
undimmed heaven behind.&nbsp; Immense, rounded projections reared themselves
from the main body, and flying, ragged fragments, apparently at a lower
level, fled beside and before them.&nbsp; These fragments of lesser
density showed innumerable tints of bluish grey from the darkest up
to one which differed but little from the pure sky-blue surrounding
them.&nbsp; Just after the sun set a rosy flush of light spread almost
instantaneously up to the zenith and in an instant had gone.&nbsp; Low
down in the west was a long, broadish bar of orange light, crossed by
the black pines on the hill half a mile away.&nbsp; Their stems and
the outline of each piece of foliage were as distinct as if they were
but a hundred yards distant.&nbsp; Half the length of the field in front
of me lay a small pool full to its grassy margin.&nbsp; It reflected
with such singular fidelity the light and colour above it that it seemed
itself to be an original source of light and colour.&nbsp; Of all the
sights to be seen in this part of the world none are more strangely
and suggestively beautiful than the little patches of rain or spring
water in the twilight on the moorland or meadows.&nbsp; Presently the
wind rose again, and a rain-squall followed.&nbsp; It passed, and the
stars began to come out, and Orion showed himself above the eastern
woods.&nbsp; He seemed as if he were marching through the moonlit scud
which drove against him.&nbsp; How urgent all the business of this afternoon
and evening has been, and yet what it meant who could say?&nbsp; I was
like a poor man&rsquo;s child who, looking out from the cottage window,
beholds with amazement a great army traversing the plain before him
with banners and music and knows nothing of its errand.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE END OF THE NORTH WIND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>For about six weeks from the middle of February we had bitter northerly
winds.&nbsp; The frost was not very severe, but the wind penetrated
the thickest clothing and searched the house through and through.&nbsp;
The shrubs, even the hardiest, were blackened by its virulence.&nbsp;
There was scarcely any sunshine, and every now and then a gloomy haze,
like the smoke in London suburbs, invaded us.&nbsp; The rise and fall
of the barometer meant nothing more than a variation in the strength
of the polar current.&nbsp; Growth was nearly arrested, although one
morning I found three primroses in a sheltered hollow.&nbsp; Never had
the weather seemed more hopeless than towards the close of March.&nbsp;
On the last evening of the month the sky was curiously perplexed and
agitated notwithstanding there was little movement in the air above
or below.&nbsp; Next morning the change had come.&nbsp; The wind had
backed to the south, and a storm from the Channel was raging with torrents
of warm rain.&nbsp; O the day that followed!&nbsp; Massive April clouds
hung in the air.&nbsp; How much the want of visible support adds to
their charm!&nbsp; One enormous cloud, with its base nearly on the horizon,
rose up forty-five degrees or so towards the zenith.&nbsp; Its weight
looked tremendous, but it floated lightly in the blue which encompassed
it.&nbsp; Towards the centre it was swollen and dark, but its edges
were dazzling white.&nbsp; While I was watching it, it went away to
the east and partly broke up.&nbsp; A new cloud, like and not like,
succeeded it . . . I followed the lane, stopped for a few minutes at
a corner where the grassy road-margin widens out near the tumble-down
barn, looked over the gate westward across the valley to the hills beyond,
and then went down to the brook that winds along the bottom.&nbsp; It
runs in a course which it has cut for itself, and is flanked on either
side by delicately-carved miniature cliffs of yellow sandstone overhung
with broom and furze.&nbsp; It was full of pure glittering moor-water,
which seemed to add light to the stones in its bed, so brilliant was
their colour.&nbsp; It fell with incessant, rippling murmur over its
little ledges, gathering itself up into pools between each, and so it
went on to the mill-pond a mile away.&nbsp; Close to me a blackbird
was building her nest.&nbsp; She moved when I peeped at her, but presently
returned.&nbsp; Her back was struck by the warm sun and was glossy in
its rays.&nbsp; A scramble of half a mile up a rough track brought me
to the common, and there, thirty miles distant, lay the chalk downs,
unsubstantial, a light-blue mist.</p>
<p>Youth with its heat in the blood may be more capable of exultation
at this season, but to the old man it brings the sounder hope and deeper
joy.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ROMNEY MARSH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Proceeding from a source of untaught things&rsquo;<br />(<i>Prelude</i>
xiii. 310)</p>
<p>Here is Appledore; over there is Romney Marsh.&nbsp; The sky has
partly cleared after heavy, south-westerly rain.&nbsp; On the horizon
where the sea lies the clouds are in a line, and the air is so clear
that their edges are sharp against the blue.&nbsp; Nearer to me they
are slowly dissolving, re-forming, and moving eastwards, and their shadows
are crossing the wide grassy plain on which in the distance Lydd Church
is just discernible.&nbsp; I can report something of those greys and
that azure, but the best part of what is before me will not outline
itself to me.&nbsp; Still less can I shape it in speech.&nbsp; Necessity,
majestic inevitable movement, the folly of heat and hurry, all this
emerges and again is blended in the simple unity of transcendent loveliness.&nbsp;
But beyond there is something so close, so precious! and yet elusive
of every effort to grasp it.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>She came to meet me from the line<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lies
the ocean miles away;<br />And now she&rsquo;s close; she must be mine:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
wait the word that she must say.</p>
<p>The magic word is not for me:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision fades,
and far and near<br />The west wind stirs the grassy sea<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
whispers to the watching ear.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>AXMOUTH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A true Devonshire village, sloping upwards from the Axe.&nbsp; The
cottages are thatched, and the walls are of cobbles, plastered.&nbsp;
A little gurgling stream runs down the village street, and over the
stream each cottage on its bank has a little bridge.&nbsp; The poor
brook is much troubled, unhappily, by cabbage leaves and the like defilement,
and does its best to oversweep them and carry them away, but does not
quite succeed.&nbsp; In a few minutes, however, it will be in the Axe,
and in half an hour it will be in the pure sea.&nbsp; A farmhouse stands
at the end of the village with a farmyard of deep manure and black puddles
coming up to the side-door.&nbsp; The church, once interesting, has
been restored with more than usual barbarity, blue slates, villa ridge-tiles,
the vulgarest cheap pavement, tawdry decorations and furniture, such
as are supplied to churchwardens by ecclesiastical tradesmen.&nbsp;
But the tower is still grey, and has looked unchanged over the Axe estuary
for hundreds of years.&nbsp; Turning up from the main street is a Devonshire
lane eight feet wide or thereabouts.&nbsp; It ascends to a farm on the
hillside, and its steep high banks are covered with ferns and primroses.&nbsp;
A tiny brooklet twitters down by its side.&nbsp; At the top of the down
is a line of old hawthorns blown slantingly by south-west storms into
a close, solid mass of shoots and prickles.&nbsp; They are dwarfed in
their struggle, but have thick trunks, many of them covered with brilliant
yellow lichen.</p>
<p>For miles and miles before it comes to Axmouth, and above Axminster,
the Axe flows in singular loops, often returning almost upon itself,
reluctant to quit the lovely land of its birth, youth, and maturity;
but now it is straighter, for it is in the lowlands and feels the tide.&nbsp;
Flocks of seagulls wade or float in it.&nbsp; It passes quietly under
its last bridge, but beyond it is confronted by a huge shingle barrier.&nbsp;
Sweeping alongside it, it suddenly turns at right angles, cuts its way
through with an exulting rush, holds back for a few yards the sea waves
that ripple against it, and is then lost.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE PREACHER AND THE SEA</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>This morning as I walked by the sea, a man was preaching on the sands
to about a dozen people, and I stopped for a few minutes to listen.&nbsp;
He told us that we were lying under the wrath of God, that we might
die at any moment, and that if we did not believe in the Lord Jesus
we should be damned everlastingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Believe in the Lord,&rsquo;
he shouted, &lsquo;believe or you will be lost; you can do nothing of
yourselves; you must be saved by grace alone, by blood, without blood
is no remission of sins.&nbsp; Some of you think, no doubt, you are
good people, and you may be, as the world goes, but your righteousness
is as filthy rags, you are all wounds and bruises and putrefying sores;
the devil will have you if you don&rsquo;t turn to the Lord, and you
will go down to the bottomless, brimstone pit, where shall be wailing
and gnashing of teeth for ever and ever.&nbsp; Believe,&rsquo; he roared,
&lsquo;now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sunny clouds lay in the blue above him, and at his feet summer waves
were breaking peacefully on the shore, the sound of their soft, musical
plash filling up his pauses and commenting on his texts.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CONVERSION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In 1802 Lady B. was living at M--- Park.&nbsp; She was a proud, handsome,
worldly woman about fifty-five years old, a widow with no children,
but she had a favourite nephew who was at the Park for the larger part
of the year and was the heir to her property.&nbsp; She had been gay
in her youth, was the leader of society in her county, and when she
passed middle life still followed the hounds.&nbsp; She was a good landlord,
respected and even beloved by her tenantry, and a staunch Tory in politics.&nbsp;
The new evangelical school of Newton and Romaine she detested bitterly,
as much in fact as she detested Popery.&nbsp; The nephew, however, came
under Newton&rsquo;s influence and was converted.&nbsp; His aunt was
in despair.&nbsp; She could not conquer her affection for him, but she
almost raved when she reflected that the inheritor of her estates was
a pious Methodist, as she called him.&nbsp; She had a good-looking,
confidential maid who had lived with her for years.&nbsp; In one of
her fits she told this maid that she would give half of what she possessed
if her nephew were like other young men.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
want him to be a sot or to gamble away my money,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;but
there&rsquo;s not much else I should mind if he were but a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few days afterwards she spoke to her maid again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look
you here, Jarvis, I shall go distracted.&nbsp; This morning he began
to speak to me about my soul - the brave boy that he used to be, talking
of my soul to <i>me</i>!&nbsp; Listen to what I tell you and be reasonable.&nbsp;
I know perfectly well, and so do you, that before he took up with this
sickening cant he was in love with you and you were in love with him.&nbsp;
I saw it all and said nothing.&nbsp; I understand there&rsquo;s no more
flirting now.&nbsp; Ah, well, his blood is red yet; I&rsquo;ve not forgotten
what five-and-twenty is, and he&rsquo;ll come if you whistle.&nbsp;
You can&rsquo;t marry him, of course, but you can and shall live comfortably
afterwards for all that, and when he has done what all other young fellows
do there will be an end to the prayer-meetings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl was a little staggered, but after a time her mistress&rsquo;s
suggestion ceased to shock her, for the nephew was a handsome fellow
capable of raising passion in a woman.&nbsp; What the aunt had said
was really true.&nbsp; She now threw the girl in his way.&nbsp; She
was sent to him with messages when he was alone, and one evening when
he had gone over to a prayer-meeting in the town about two miles away,
she was directed to go there on an errand, to contrive to be late, and
to return with him.&nbsp; She had half an hour to spare and was curious
to know what the prayer-meeting was like.&nbsp; She stood close to the
inner door, which was slightly ajar, and heard her master praying earnestly.&nbsp;
He rose and spoke to the little congregation for five minutes.&nbsp;
When he had finished she started for home, and he came up with her before
she had passed the last house.&nbsp; It was nearly dark, but he recognised
her by a light from a window, and asked her what she was doing in the
town at that hour.&nbsp; She excused herself by unexpected detention,
and they went on together.&nbsp; About half a mile further at the top
of the hill was the stile of the pathway that was a short cut to the
park.&nbsp; From that point there was an extensive view over the plain
eastwards, and the rising moon was just emerging from a line of silvered
clouds.&nbsp; They were both struck with the beauty of the spectacle
and stood still gazing at it.</p>
<p>Suddenly she dropped on her knees and with violent sobbing called
upon God to help her.&nbsp; He lifted her up, and when she was calmer
she told him everything.&nbsp; They went on their way in silence.&nbsp;
Now comes the remarkable part of the story.&nbsp; It was he who would
have been the tempter and she had saved him.&nbsp; When they reached
the Park he found his aunt ill, and in a fortnight she was dead.&nbsp;
In less than two years nephew and maid were married.&nbsp; His strict
evangelicalism relaxed a little, but they were both faithful to their
Friend.&nbsp; Lovers also they were to the last, and they died in the
same month after each of them had passed seventy-five years.</p>
<p>I fancy I read a long while ago somewhere in Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i>
that an attempt was made to ruin him or one of his friends with a woman,
but I think she was a bad woman.&nbsp; If there is anything of the kind
in the <i>Journal</i> it shows that Lady B&rsquo;s plot is not incredible.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>JULY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It is a cool day in July, and the shaded sunlight slowly steals and
disappears over the landscape.&nbsp; There are none of those sudden
flashes which come when the clouds are more sharply defined and the
blue is more intense.&nbsp; I have wandered from the uplands down to
the river.&nbsp; The fields are cleared of the hay, and the bright green
of the newly mown grass increases the darkness of the massive foliage
of the bordering elms.&nbsp; The cows are feeding in the rich level
meadows and now and then come to the river to drink.&nbsp; It is overhung
with alders, and two or three stand on separate little islands held
together by roots.&nbsp; The winter floods biting into the banks have
cut miniature cliffs, and at their base grow the forget-me-not, the
willow-herb, and flowering rush.&nbsp; A brightly-plumaged bird, too
swift to be recognised - could it be a kingfisher? - darts along the
margin of the stream and disappears in its black shadows.&nbsp; The
wind blows gently from the west: it is just strong enough to show the
silver sides of the willow leaves.&nbsp; The sound of the weir, although
so soft, is able to exclude the clacking of the mill and all intermittent,
casual noises.&nbsp; For two hours it has filled my ears and brought
a deeper repose than that of mere silence.&nbsp; It is not uniform,
for the voices of innumerable descending threads of water with varying
impulses can be distinguished, but it is a unity.&nbsp; Myriads of bubbles
rise from the leaping foam at the bottom, float away for a few yards
and then break.</p>
<p>It is the very summit of the year, the brief poise of perfection.&nbsp;
In two or three weeks the days will be noticeably shorter, the harvest
will begin, and we shall be on our way downwards to autumn, to dying
leaves and to winter.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A SUNDAY MORNING IN NOVEMBER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The walk from the high moorland to the large pond or lake lies through
a narrow grassy lane.&nbsp; About half-way down it turns sharply to
the left; in front are the bluish-green pine woods.&nbsp; Across the
corner of them, confronting me, slants a birch with its white bark and
delicate foliage, light-green and yellow in relief against the sombre
background.&nbsp; Fifty yards before I reach the wood its music is perceptible,
something like the tones of an organ heard outside a cathedral.&nbsp;
In another minute the lane enters: it is dark, but the ruddy stems catch
the sun, and in open patches are small beeches responding to it with
intense golden-brown.&nbsp; Along the edge of the path, springing from
the mossy bank they grow to a greater height.&nbsp; A pine has pushed
itself between the branches of one of them as if on purpose to show
off the splendour of its sister&rsquo;s beauty.&nbsp; It is stiller
than it was outside; the murmur descends from aloft.&nbsp; There was
a frost last night and the leaves will soon fall.&nbsp; A beech leaf
detaches itself now and then and flutters peacefully and waywardly to
the ground, careless whether it finds its grave in the bracken or on
the road where it will be trodden underfoot.&nbsp; The bramble is beginning
to turn to blood.&nbsp; It is strange that leaves should show such character.&nbsp;
Here is a corner on which there are not two of the same tint, but they
spring from the same root, and the circumstances of light and shade
under which they have developed are almost exactly similar.</p>
<p>It is eleven o&rsquo;clock, and with the mounting sun the silence
has become complete save when it is broken by the heavy, quick flap
of the wood-pigeon or the remonstrance of a surprised magpie.&nbsp;
Service is just beginning all over England in churches and the chapels
belonging to a hundred sects.&nbsp; In the village two miles away the
Salvation Army drum is beating, but it cannot penetrate these recesses.&nbsp;
Stay! a faint vibration from it comes over the hill, but now it has
gone.&nbsp; A fox, unaware of any human being, walks from one side of
the lane to the other, stopping in the middle.&nbsp; There is a breath
of wind and the low solemn song begins again above me.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>UNDER BEACHY HEAD: DECEMBER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>At the top of the hill the north-westerly wind blows fresh, but here
under the cliffs the sun strikes warm as in June.&nbsp; There is not
a cloud in the sky, and behind me broken, chalk pinnacles intensely
white rise into the clear blue, which is bluer by their contrast.&nbsp;
In front lies the calm, light-sapphire ocean with a glittering sun-path
on it broadening towards the horizon.&nbsp; All recollection of bare
trees and dead leaves has gone.&nbsp; The tide is drawing down and has
left bare a wide expanse of smooth untrodden sand through which ridges
run of chalk rock black with weed.&nbsp; The sand is furrowed by little
rivulets from the abandoned pools above, and at its edge long low waves
ripple over it, flattening themselves out in thin sheets which invade
one another with infinitely complex, graceful curves.&nbsp; I look southward:
there is nothing between me and the lands of heat but the water.&nbsp;
It unites me with them.</p>
<p>It is wonderful that winter should suddenly abdicate and summer resume
her throne.&nbsp; On a morning like this there is no death, the sin
of the world is swallowed up; theological and metaphysical problems
cease to have any meaning.&nbsp; Men and books make me painfully aware
of my littleness and defects, but here on the shore in silence complete
save for the music of the ebbing sea, they vanish.</p>
<p>When I am again in London and at work the dazzling light will not
be extinguished, and will illuminate the dreary darkness of the city.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>24TH DECEMBER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>My housekeeper and her husband have begged for a holiday from this
morning till Boxing-day, and I could not refuse.&nbsp; I can do without
them for so short a time.&nbsp; I might have spent the Christmas with
one of my children, but they live far away and travelling is now irksome
to me.&nbsp; I was seventy years old a month past.&nbsp; Besides, they
are married and have their own friends, of whom I know nothing.&nbsp;
I have locked the door of my cottage and shall walk to No-man&rsquo;s
Corner.</p>
<p>It is a dark day; the sky is covered evenly with a thick cloud.&nbsp;
There is no wind except a breath now and then from the north-east.&nbsp;
It is not a frost, but it is cold, and a thick mist covers the landscape.&nbsp;
It is no thicker in the river bottom than on the hills; it is everywhere
the same.&nbsp; The field-paths are in many places a foot deep in mud,
for the autumn has been wet.&nbsp; They are ploughing the Ten Acres,
and the plough is going along the top ridge so that horses and men are
distinctly outlined, two men and four horses, but the pace is slow,
for the ground is very heavy.&nbsp; I can just hear the ploughman talking
to his team.&nbsp; The upturned earth is more beautiful in these parts
than I have seen it elsewhere - a rich, reddish brown, for there is
iron in it.&nbsp; The sides of the clods which are smoothed by the ploughshare
shine like silver even in this dull light.&nbsp; I pass through the
hop-garden.&nbsp; The poles are stacked and a beginning has just been
made with the weeds.&nbsp; A little further on is the farmhouse.&nbsp;
It lies in the hollow and there is no road to it, save a cart-track.&nbsp;
The nearest hard road is half a mile distant.&nbsp; The footpath crosses
the farmyard.&nbsp; The house is whitewashed plaster and black-timbered,
and surrounded by cattle-pens in which the oxen and cows stand almost
up to their knees in slush.&nbsp; A motionless ox looks over the bar
of his pen and turns his eyes to me and my dog as we pass.&nbsp; It
is now twelve, and it is the dinner-hour.&nbsp; The horses have stopped
work and are steaming with sweat under the hayrick.&nbsp; The men are
sitting in the barn.&nbsp; Leaving the farmyard I go down to the brook
which steals round the wood and stop for a few minutes on the foot-bridge.&nbsp;
I can hear the little stream in the gully about twenty feet below, continually
changing its note, which nevertheless is always the same.&nbsp; In the
wood not a leaf falls.&nbsp; O eternal sleep, death of the passions,
the burial of failures, follies, bitter recollections, the end of fears,
welcome sleep!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>DREAMING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>During the retreat from Moscow a French soldier was mortally wounded.&nbsp;
His comrades tried to lift him into a waggon.&nbsp; &lsquo;No bandages,
no brandy!&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;go, you cannot help me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
They hesitated, but seeing that he could not recover, and knowing that
the enemy was hard upon them in pursuit, they left him.&nbsp; For half
an hour he was alive and alone.&nbsp; The Emperor, whom he worshipped,
was far away; his friends had fled; to remain would have been folly,
and yet!&nbsp; It was late in the afternoon and bitterly cold.&nbsp;
He looked with dim and closing eyes over the vast, dreary, snowy and
silent plain.&nbsp; What were the images which passed before them?&nbsp;
Were they of home, of the Emperor and the retreating army, of the crucifix
and the figure thereon?&nbsp; Who can tell?&nbsp; Death is preceded
by thoughts which life cannot anticipate.&nbsp; Perhaps his herald was
a simple longing to be at rest, joy at his approach blotting out all
bitterness and regret.&nbsp; Who can tell?&nbsp; But I dream and dream;
the dying, wintry day, the dark, heavily-clouded sky, the snow, and
the blood.&nbsp; A Cossack came up and drove his lance through him.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>OURSELVES</h2>

<p>Lord Bacon says that &lsquo;To be wise by rule and to be wise by
experience are contrary proceedings; he that accustoms himself to the
one unfits himself for the other.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is singular how little
attention, in the guidance of our lives, we pay to our own needs.&nbsp;
It is a common falsehood of these times that all knowledge is good for
everybody, the truth being that knowledge is good only if it helps us,
and that if it does not help us it is bad.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whatever knowledge,&rsquo;
to quote from Bacon again, &lsquo;we cannot convert into food or medicine
endangereth a dissolution of the mind and understanding.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We ought to turn aside from what we cannot manage, no matter how important
it may seem to be.&nbsp; David refused Saul&rsquo;s helmet of brass
and coat of mail.&nbsp; If he had taken the orthodox accoutrements and
weapons he would have been encumbered and slain.&nbsp; He killed Goliath
with the rustic sling and stone.&nbsp; No doubt if we determine to be
ignorant of those things with which the world thinks it necessary that
everybody should be familiar we shall be thought ill-educated, but our
very ignorance will be a better education, provided it be a principled
ignorance, than much which secures a local examination certificate or
a degree.&nbsp; At the same time, if any study fits us, it should be
pursued unflaggingly.&nbsp; We must not be afraid of the imputation
of narrowness.&nbsp; Our subject will begin to be of most service to
us when we have passed the threshold and can think for ourselves.&nbsp;
If we devote ourselves, for example, to the works and biography of any
great man, the pleasure and moral effect come when we have read him
and re-read him and have traced every thread we can find, connecting
him with his contemporaries.&nbsp; It is then, and then only, that we
understand him and he becomes a living soul.&nbsp; Flesh and blood are
given by details.</p>
<p>We are misled by heroes whom we admire, and the greater the genius
the more perilous is its influence upon us if we allow it to be a dictator
to us.&nbsp; It is really of little consequence to me what a saint or
philosopher thought it necessary to do in order to protect and save
himself.&nbsp; It is myself that I have to protect and save.&nbsp; Every
man is prone to lean on some particular side and on that side requires
special support.&nbsp; Every man has particular fears and troubles,
and it is against these and not against the fears and troubles of others
that he must provide remedies.&nbsp; A religion is but a general direction,
and the real working Thirty-nine Articles or Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism
each one of us has to construct on his own behalf.</p>
<p>A not insignificant advantage of loyalty to our Divine Director will
be a more correct and generally a more lenient criticism of our fellow-creatures.&nbsp;
We shall cease to judge them by standards which are not applicable to
them.&nbsp; Much that we might erroneously consider wrong we shall discern
to be a necessary effort to secure stability or even to preserve sanity.&nbsp;
We shall pardon deviation from the obvious path.&nbsp; The boat which
crosses the river may traverse obliquely the direct line to the point
for which it is making, and if we reflect that perhaps a strong current
besets it we shall not call the steersman a fool.</p>

<h2>THE RIDDLE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Men had sinned against the gods, and had even denied their existence.&nbsp;
Zeus had a mind to destroy them, but at last resolved to inflict on
them a punishment worse than death.&nbsp; He sent Hermes to one of the
chief cities with a scroll on which a few magic letters were written,
and the wise men declared they contained a riddle.&nbsp; Its solution
would bring immortal happiness.&nbsp; The whole human race, neglecting
all ordinary pursuits, applied itself ceaselessly to the solution of
the mystery.&nbsp; Professors were appointed to lecture on it, it was
attacked on all sides by induction, deduction, and by flights of inspiration,
but nobody was able to unravel it.&nbsp; At last a child, seeing the
perplexity in which her father and mother were, took one of the copies
of the scroll which were hung in all the public buildings of the city,
and secretly set off to consult a distant oracle of Ph&oelig;bus Apollo
of which she had heard.&nbsp; She had to traverse thirsty deserts, and
not till she was nearly dead did she reach the shrine.&nbsp; She told
her story and handed in her scroll to a priestess, who disappeared in
an inner chamber.&nbsp; In a few minutes the temple of the Sun-god was
filled with blazing light, the child prostrated herself on the floor,
and she heard the words, <i>There is no riddle</i>.&nbsp; She lifted
herself up, and, fortified with some food given her by the priestess,
began her journey home.&nbsp; She was just able to struggle through
the city gates and deliver the message before she fell down lifeless.&nbsp;
It was not believed; the Secret, the Secret, everybody upheld it, the
professors lectured, the mad inquisition and guesses continued, and
the vengeance of Zeus is not yet satisfied.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>AN EPOCH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I was no longer young: in fact I was well over sixty.&nbsp; The winter
had been dark and tedious.&nbsp; For some reason or other I had not
been able to read much, and I began to think there were signs of the
coming end.&nbsp; Suddenly, with hardly any warning, spring burst upon
us.&nbsp; Day after day we had clear, warm sunshine which deepened every
contrast of colour, and at intervals we were blessed with refreshing
rains.&nbsp; I spent most of my time out of doors on the edge of a favourite
wood.&nbsp; All my life I had been a lover of the country, and had believed,
if this is the right word, that the same thought, spirit, life, God,
which was in everything I beheld, was also in me.&nbsp; But my creed
had been taken over from books; it was accepted as an intellectual proposition.&nbsp;
Most of us are satisfied with this kind of belief, and even call it
religion.&nbsp; We are more content the more definite the object becomes,
no matter whether or not it is in any intimate relationship with us,
and we do not see that the moment God can be named he ceases to be God.</p>
<p>One morning when I was in the wood something happened which was nothing
less than a transformation of myself and the world, although I &lsquo;believed&rsquo;
nothing new.&nbsp; I was looking at a great, spreading, bursting oak.&nbsp;
The first tinge from the greenish-yellow buds was just visible.&nbsp;
It seemed to be no longer a tree away from me and apart from me.&nbsp;
The enclosing barriers of consciousness were removed and the text came
into my mind, <i>Thou in me and I in thee</i>.&nbsp; The distinction
of self and not-self was an illusion.&nbsp; I could feel the rising
sap; in me also sprang the fountain of life up-rushing from its roots,
and the joy of its outbreak at the extremity of each twig right up to
the summit was my own: that which kept me apart was nothing.&nbsp; I
do not argue; I cannot explain; it will be easy to prove me absurd,
but nothing can shake me.&nbsp; <i>Thou in me and I in thee</i>.&nbsp;
Death! what is death?&nbsp; There is no death: <i>in thee</i> it is
impossible, absurd.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>BELIEF</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>He has vanished, the God of the Church and the Schools:<br />He has
gone for us all except children and fools;<br />Where He dwelt is the
uttermost limit of cold,<br />And a fathomless depth is the Heaven of
old.</p>
<p>I turn from my books, and behold! I&rsquo;m aware<br />There&rsquo;s
a girl in the room, just a girl over there.<br />She stole in while
I mused; and she watches the verge<br />Of a low-lying cloud whence
a star doth emerge.</p>
<p>A touch on her shoulder; I whisper a word,<br />One more, and I know
that the heavenly Lord<br />Still loves and rejoices His creatures to
meet:<br />My faith still survives, for I kneel at her feet.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>EXTRACTS FROM A DIARY ON THE QUANTOCKS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Spring</i> 18--.</p>
<p>Walked from Holford to my lodgings on the hill.&nbsp; Never remember
to have lived in such quietude.&nbsp; The cottage stands half a mile
away from any house.&nbsp; Woke very early the next morning and went
down to Alfoxden House, where Wordsworth and Dorothy lived a century
ago.&nbsp; Here also came Coleridge.&nbsp; It was almost too much to
remember that they had trodden those paths.&nbsp; I could hardly believe
they were not there, and yet they were dead - such a strange overcoming
sense of presence and yet of vanishedness.</p>
<p>A certain degree of ignorance is necessary for a summary essay on
creatures of this order.&nbsp; The expression of Dorothy&rsquo;s soul
is spread over large surfaces.&nbsp; Some people require much space
and time, and the striking events of a life are often not those which
are most significant.&nbsp; It is in small, spontaneous actions and
their reiteration that character plainly appears.&nbsp; After prolonged
acquaintance with Dorothy we see that she was great and we love her
reverentially and passionately.&nbsp; She could look at a beautiful
thing for an hour without reflection, but absorbed in its pure beauty
- a most rare gift.&nbsp; For how long can we watch a birch tree against
the sky?&nbsp; Here are two extracts from her journal in the very place
where I now am.&nbsp; They are dated 26th January and 24th February
1798, in the winter it will be noticed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sat in the sunshine.&nbsp;
The distant sheep-bells; the sound of the stream; the woodman winding
along the half-marked road with his laden pony; locks of wool still
spangled with the dewdrops; the blue-grey sea, shaded with immense masses
of cloud, not streaked; the sheep glittering in the sunshine.&rsquo;
. . . &lsquo;Went to the hill-top.&nbsp; Sat a considerable time overlooking
the country towards the sea.&nbsp; The air blew pleasantly around us.
. . . Scattered farmhouses, half-concealed by green, mossy orchards;
fresh straw lying at the doors; haystacks in the fields.&nbsp; Brown
fallows; the springing wheat, like a shade of green over the brown earth;
and the choice meadow plots, full of sheep and lambs, of a soft and
vivid green; a few wreaths of blue smoke, spreading along the ground;
the oaks and beeches in the hedges retaining their yellow leaves; the
distant prospect on the land side, islanded with sunshine; the sea,
like a basin full to the margin; the dark, fresh-ploughed fields; the
turnips, of a lively, rough green.&rsquo;&nbsp; That bit about the farmhouses
reminds me of two very early lines of Wordsworth which are a prophecy
of his peculiar quality:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Calm is all nature as a resting wheel&rsquo;;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;By secret villages and lonely farms.&rsquo;<br /><i>(first
version.)</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The image in the first line looks rude and unpoetical, but will be
felt by anybody who has strolled observantly through a farmyard - say
on a Sunday summer afternoon - and has noticed a disused wheel leaning
against a wall.&nbsp; Wordsworth shows himself not afraid of the commonplace.&nbsp;
A great object may gain by comparison with one which is superficially
lower or even mean - nature with a cart-wheel.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Went over the hills to Bicknoller - a sunny, hazy day - and the Bristol
Channel was in a mist.&nbsp; The note of the cuckoo was unceasing.&nbsp;
Down in the valley at Bicknoller the hedges and banks of the lanes are
in the most ardent stage of spring.&nbsp; Everything is pressing forward
with joyous impetuosity, and yet is satisfied with what it is at the
present moment and is completely at rest in it.&nbsp; Along this path
to Bicknoller the <i>Ancient Mariner</i> was begun.&nbsp; The most wonderful
piece of criticism on record is perhaps that of Mrs. Barbauld on the
poem.&nbsp; She objected to it because it had no moral.&nbsp; Coleridge
replied: &lsquo;In my judgment the poem had too much; and the only,
or chief fault, if I might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment
so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work
of such pure imagination.&nbsp; It ought to have no more moral than
the Arabian Nights&rsquo; tale of the merchant&rsquo;s sitting down
to eat dates by the side of a well, and throwing the shells aside, and
lo! a genie starts up, and says he <i>must</i> kill the aforesaid merchant,
<i>because</i> one of the date-shells had, it seems, put out the eye
of the genie&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>To the first draft of <i>Youth and Age</i>, written in 1823, there
is a little prose introduction, a reminiscence of the Quantocks, which
is a lovely example of the way in which one sensation gains by description
in terms of another.&nbsp; &lsquo; . . .&nbsp; At earliest dawn . .
. the first skylark . . . was a Song-Fountain, dashing up and sparkling
to the Ear&rsquo;s eye, in full column or ornamented shaft of sound
in the order of Gothic Extravaganza, out of sight, over the Cornfields
on the descent of the Mountain on the other side - out of sight, tho&rsquo;
twice I beheld its mute shoot downward in the sunshine like a falling
star of silver.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Coleridge! Coleridge!&nbsp; How empty do the sweeping judgments passed
on him appear if we recollect that by Wordsworth, Dorothy, Charles and
Mary Lamb, he was honoured and fervently loved.&nbsp; If a man is loved
by any human being condemnation is rash, and we ought at least to be
silent.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Wandered about Holford.&nbsp; The apple-trees are in full blossom.&nbsp;
One of them was a particularly exquisite survival of youth in old age.&nbsp;
Its head was a white-and-pink mass, but it leaned almost horizontally,
battered and weather-worn.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Thunder off and on all day till the afternoon.&nbsp; A low grey mist
covered the whole sky at five o&rsquo;clock, and the landscape was uninteresting,
but in ten minutes the mist thinned a little, so that the sun came through
it and lighted up the torn vapour.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Went over to East Quantock&rsquo;s Head and came back across the
hill.&nbsp; It was a dark day; the sky was overcast, and the moors were
very lonely.&nbsp; The thought of London and other big cities over the
horizon somewhat marred the solitude.&nbsp; Nevertheless there are the
deserts of Arabia and Africa, the regions of the North and South Poles,
the Ocean, and, encompassing the globe itself, silent, infinite space.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>To Nether Stowey and Tom Poole&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; In the hideous
church is a monument to him fairly appreciative, but disfigured by snobbism.&nbsp;
&lsquo;His originality and grasp of mind,&rsquo; says the inscription,
&lsquo;counterbalanced the deficiencies of early education and secured
him the friendship,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; His &lsquo;originality and grasp
of mind&rsquo; - his soul, that is to say, managed, when put in the
scale, to turn it against those deficiencies which are made good to
youths providentially directed to Eton and Oxford.&nbsp; According to
the slab in the church, Poole died 8th September 1837, seventy-two years
old.&nbsp; The house in which he lived in his later years is a pleasant
place, but has been tortured into modern gentility.&nbsp; His revolving
grate, which he turned round when he went out, has been replaced by
an approved cast-iron &lsquo;register.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was called &lsquo;Justice
Poole&rsquo; in the country round.&nbsp; Afterwards to Coleridge&rsquo;s
cottage - small, somewhat squalid rooms.&nbsp; Pity, pity, almost to
tears.&nbsp; The second edition of his poems was published while he
was here in 1797.&nbsp; In a note added to <i>Religious Musings</i>
in that edition he declares his belief in the Millennium; that &lsquo;all
who in past ages have endeavoured to ameliorate the state of man, will
rise and enjoy the fruits and flowers, the imperceptible seeds of which
they had sown in their former life; and that the wicked will, during
the same period, be suffering the remedies adapted to their several
bad habits.&rsquo;&nbsp; This period is to be &lsquo;followed by the
passing away of this earth, and by our entering the state of pure intellect;
when all creation shall rest from its labours.&rsquo;&nbsp; The &lsquo;coadjutors
of God&rsquo; in <i>Religious Musings</i> are Milton, Newton, Hartley,
and Priestley.&nbsp; In the beginning of 1798 Coleridge was preaching
at the Unitarian Chapel at Shrewsbury.&nbsp; But on the 13th November
1797, at half-past four in the afternoon (let us be particular in dating
such an event), he and Dorothy and her brother began their walk over
these Quantock hills, and <i>The Ancient Mariner</i> was born.&nbsp;
These are the facts, and rash indeed would anybody be who should attempt
to deduce anything from them.&nbsp; Of all foolish criticism there is
none more foolish than that which treats the mental movement of men
like Coleridge or Wordsworth as if it were in an imaginary straight
line.&nbsp; Excepting lines 123-270, composed in the latter part of
1796, Coleridge wrote his contribution to <i>Joan of Arc</i> between
1794 and 1795.&nbsp; <i>The Rose</i> and <i>Kisses</i> were written
in 1793, and <i>On a Discovery Made Too Late</i> in 1794.&nbsp; Could
anybody, not knowing the dates, have believed that these three poems
last-named, if not written before the <i>Joan of Arc</i>, were contemporaneous
with it?&nbsp; In the <i>Joan of Arc</i> Coleridge is immature and led
astray by politics, religion, and philosophy, but in the three little
poems where he has subjects akin to him he is perfect, and could have
done nothing better ten years later.&nbsp; Still more remarkable, <i>Lewti</i>,
in its earliest form, cannot have been written later than 1794, for
it was originally addressed to Mary Evans, from whom Coleridge parted
in December 1794.&nbsp; As an example of the survival of his poetic
power take <i>Love&rsquo;s First Hope</i>, written probably in 1824:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;O fair is Love&rsquo;s first hope to gentle mind!<br />As
Eve&rsquo;s first star thro&rsquo; fleecy cloudlet peeping;<br />And
sweeter than the gentle south-west wind,<br />O&rsquo;er willowy meads,
and shadow&rsquo;d waters creeping,<br />And Ceres&rsquo; golden field;
- the sultry hind<br />Meets it with brow uplift, and stays his reaping.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Coleridge was indebted to Sir Philip Sidney for the third and fourth
lines, excepting &lsquo;o&rsquo;er willowy meads,&rsquo; but these three
words and the first and last two lines are his own.&nbsp; Not only does
his genius survive, but emotion as pure and deep as that of the Nether
Stowey days or those preceding.&nbsp; There is no trace of the interval
between them and those of 1824.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the post-office at Kilve hangs an old trombone, a memento of the
time when the village orchestra assisted in the service at the church.&nbsp;
How well I remember those artists and their jealousies!&nbsp; The clarionet
or &lsquo;clarnet,&rsquo; as he called himself, caused much ill-feeling
because he drowned the others, and the double-bass strove ineffectually
to avenge himself.&nbsp; The churchyard yew is one of the largest I
ever beheld - twenty feet in girth by measurement, four feet from the
ground.&nbsp; A gay morning: heavy, white masses of clouds sailing over
the hills; light most brilliant when the sun came out.&nbsp; How singularly
beautiful is a definitely outlined white cloud when it is cut by the
ridge of a hill!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Across the hills in a south-westerly storm of wind and rain to Bicknoller.&nbsp;
A walk not to be forgotten: overcast sky, dark moors; clouds sweeping
over them and obscuring them.&nbsp; I should not have found my way if
I had not lost it when I went to Bicknoller before.&nbsp; I then put
three stones at the point where I afterwards discovered I had gone astray.&nbsp;
These three stones saved me to-day.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Whitsunday morning: sat at the open window between five and six:
the hills opposite lay in the light of the eastern sun.&nbsp; Bicknoller
church and the little old village were beneath me.&nbsp; Perfect quietude,
save for the bells of Stogumber church ringing a peal two miles away.&nbsp;
Earth has nothing to give compared with this peace.&nbsp; The air was
so still that delicious mingled scents floated up from the garden and
fields below.&nbsp; It was one of those days on which every sense is
satisfied, and no mortal imperfection appears.&nbsp; Took the <i>Excursion</i>
out of doors after breakfast, and read <i>The Ruined Cottage.</i></p>
<p>Much of the religion by which Wordsworth lives is very indefinite.&nbsp;
Look at the close of this poem:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;I well remember that those very plumes,<br />Those weeds,
and the high spear-grass on that wall<br />By mist and silent rain-drops
silver&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er,<br />As once I pass&rsquo;d, did to my heart
convey<br />So still an image of tranquillity,<br />So calm and still,
and look&rsquo;d so beautiful<br />Amid the uneasy thoughts which fill&rsquo;d
my mind,<br />That what we feel of sorrow and despair<br />From ruin
and from change, and all the grief<br />The passing shows of Being leave
behind,<br />Appear&rsquo;d an idle dream, that could not live<br />Where
meditation was.&nbsp; I turn&rsquo;d away,<br />And walk&rsquo;d along
my road in happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Because this religion is indefinite it is not therefore the less
supporting.</p>
<p>Why, by the way, did Wordsworth expunge from <i>Michael</i> these
wonderful lines?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;In his thoughts there were obscurities,<br />Wonder, and admiration,
things that wrought<br />Not less than a religion in his heart.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Something like them had been said before, but they ought to have
been retained.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The changes in the sky in this Quantock country are as sudden and
strange as in Cumberland.&nbsp; During a walk from Cleeve Abbey to Bicknoller
it rained in torrents till within half a mile of the end of my journey.&nbsp;
All at once it ceased, and the uniform sheet of rain-cloud broke into
loose ragged masses swirling in different directions and variously lighted,
the sun almost shining through some of the clefts between them.&nbsp;
Cleeve Abbey, lying in the trough of a green valley through which runs
a stream, the cloister garth and the Abbot&rsquo;s seat at the end of
it, are most impressive.&nbsp; Under the turf lie the dead monks.&nbsp;
A place like this begets half-unconscious dreaming which issues in nothing
and is not wholesome.&nbsp; It would be better employment to learn something
about the history of the abbey and about its architecture.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>DETACHED QUANTOCK NOTES.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ye Woods! that listen to the night-birds&rsquo; singing,<br />Midway
the smooth and perilous slope reclined,<br />Save where your own imperious
branches swinging,<br />Have made a solemn music of the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>These lines from <i>France</i> were written by Coleridge when he
was a little over twenty-five years old.&nbsp; In the combination of
two gifts, music and meaning, he is hardly surpassable at his best by
any poet.&nbsp; Not an atom of meaning is sacrificed to gain a melody:
in fact the melody adds to the meaning.</p>
<p>Here is another example showing how the poetic form with Coleridge
is not a hindrance to expression, but aids it.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Gentle woman, for thy voice remeasures<br />Whatever tones and melancholy
pleasures<br />The things of Nature utter; birds or trees,<br />Or moan
of ocean-gale in weedy caves,<br />Or where the stiff grass &rsquo;mid
the heath-plant waves,<br />Murmur and music thin of sudden breeze.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>His similitudes are not mere external comparisons; the objects compared
become <i>modes</i> of unity.&nbsp; &lsquo;A brisk gale and the foam
that peopled the <i>alive</i> [italics C.&rsquo;s] sea, most interestingly
combined with the number of white seagulls, that, repeatedly, it seemed
as if the foam-spit had taken life and wing, and had flown up.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The intimations which are but whispered, the Presences which are
but half-disclosed, are those which we should intently obey.&nbsp; The
coarsely obvious has its own strength.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;She went forth alone<br />Urged by the indwelling
angel-guide, that oft,<br />With dim inexplicable sympathies<br />Disquieting
the heart, shapes out Man&rsquo;s course<br />To the predoomed adventure.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Destiny of Nations.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Wordworth&rsquo;s habit of spending so much time in the open air
and with the humble people around him gives to what he says the value
of experience, distinguishable totally from the ideas of the literary
man, which may be brilliant, but do not agree with the sun, moon and
stars, and turn out to be nothing when we ask is the thing really <i>so.</i></p>
<p>Wordsworth&rsquo;s verses have been in the sun and wind.&nbsp; It
is a test of good sane writing that we can read it out of doors.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>If Wordsworth&rsquo;s love of clouds and mountains ended there it
would be no better than the luxury of a refined taste.&nbsp; But it
does not end there.&nbsp; It affects the whole of his relationships
with men and women, and is therefore most practical.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In Wordsworth what we expect does not come, but in its place the
unexpected.&nbsp; In the twelfth book of the <i>Prelude</i> he tells
us:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There are in our existence spots of time,<br />That with distinct
pre-eminence retain<br />A renovating virtue, whence, depressed<br />By
false opinion and contentious thought,<br />Or aught of heavier or more
deadly weight<br />In trivial occupations, and the round<br />Of ordinary
intercourse, our minds<br />Are nourished and invisibly repaired;<br />A
virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,<br />That penetrates, enables
us to mount,<br />When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen.<br />This
efficacious spirit chiefly lurks<br />Among those passages of life that
give<br />Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,<br />The mind
is lord and master - outward sense<br />The obedient servant of her
will.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He then gives us one of these &lsquo;passages,&rsquo; and what is
it?&nbsp; A day when as a child he saw</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;A naked pool that lay beneath the hills,<br />The beacon on
the summit, and, more near,<br />A girl, who bore a pitcher on her head,<br />And
seemed with difficult steps to force her way<br />Against the blowing
wind.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It was, as he says, an &lsquo;ordinary sight,&rsquo; but</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Colours and words that are unknown to man&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>would have failed him</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;To paint the visionary dreariness&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>which invested what he saw.</p>
<p>Years afterwards, when he revisited the spot, the &lsquo;loved one
at his side,&rsquo; there fell on it</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;A spirit of pleasure and youth&rsquo;s golden gleam;<br />And
think ye not with radiance more sublime<br />For these remembrances,
and for the power<br />They had left behind?&nbsp; So feeling comes
in aid<br />Of feeling, and diversity of strength<br />Attends us, if
but once we have been strong.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This was the experience, then, of &lsquo;distinct pre-eminence&rsquo;
in whose recollection his mind was &lsquo;nourished and invisibly repaired.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is in such a moment that the soul&rsquo;s strength is shown; when
common objects evoke what he calls the imagination, the reality, of
which they are a suggestion.&nbsp; Although he expands here and elsewhere
he does not elaborate.&nbsp; He stops where the fact ends and shuns
abstractions.</p>

<p>An example of Wordsworth&rsquo;s wisdom disclosing itself in his
simplest pieces.&nbsp; For one sad conclusion to which the reason leads
us, the uncontrolled, baseless procedure in the brain which we call
thinking, but is really day-dreaming, leads us to a score.&nbsp; Reason
on the whole is sanative.</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Exist not.&nbsp; We are befooled by words.&nbsp; We conceive wisdom,
prudence, and magnanimity as distinct entities, without intercommunication.&nbsp;
If we could but see things as they are without the tyranny of definition!</p>

<p>Wordsworth has a singular power of expressing articulately that which
would be mere mist without him, but is of vital importance.</p>

<h2>GODWIN AND WORDSWORTH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(Reprinted from <i>The Pilot</i>, 20th April 1901.&nbsp; With added
postscript.)</p>
<p>Dr. &Eacute;mile Legouis, in his singularly interesting book, <i>La
Jeunesse de William Wordsworth</i>, well translated into English by
Mr. T. W. Matthews (Dent and Co., 1897), calls attention to the influence
on Wordsworth in his early years of Godwin&rsquo;s <i>Political Justice</i>.&nbsp;
On reading <i>Political Justice</i> now, it is difficult to understand
why Wordsworth should have been so much affected by it.&nbsp; Its philosophy,
if philosophy it can be called, is simply the denial of any rule of
conduct or of any belief which the understanding cannot prove, and the
inclusion of man in the necessity which controls inanimate nature.&nbsp;
&lsquo;All vice is nothing more than error and mistake&rsquo; (i. 31).
<a name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205">{205}</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;We
differ from the inferior animals in the greater facility with which
we arrange our sensations, and compare, prefer, and judge&rsquo; (i.
57).&nbsp; &lsquo;Justice . . . is coincident with utility&rsquo; (i.
121).&nbsp; &lsquo;If my mother were in a house on fire, and I had a
ladder outside with which I could save her, she would not, because she
was my mother, have any greater claim than the other inmates on my exertions&rsquo;
(i. 83).&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; says an objector, &lsquo;your mother
nourished you in the helplessness of infancy.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;When
she first subjected herself,&rsquo; replies Godwin, &lsquo;to the necessity
of these cares, she was probably influenced by no particular motives
of benevolence to her future offspring. . . .&nbsp; It is the disposition
of the mind . . . that entitles to respect,&rsquo; and consequently
justice demands that I should rescue the most meritorious person first.&rsquo;&nbsp;
All moral science may be reduced to this one head, calculation of the
future&rsquo; (ii. 468), and consequently a promise is not an obligation.&nbsp;
The statement that it is essential that we should be able to depend
on engagements &lsquo;would be somewhat more accurate if we said &ldquo;that
it was essential to various circumstances of human intercourse, that
we should be known to bestow a steady attention upon the quantities
of convenience or inconvenience, of good or evil, that might arise to
others from our conduct&rdquo;&rsquo; (i. 156).&nbsp; The understanding
is supreme in us, and &lsquo;depravity would have gained little ground
in the world, if every man had been in the exercise of his independent
judgment&rsquo; (i. 174).&nbsp; Reason (the Godwinian Reason) is sufficient
to control or even extinguish the strongest of all passions.&nbsp; Marriage
having been denounced as &lsquo;the most odious of all monopolies&rsquo;
(ii. 850), Godwin is reminded that half a dozen men perhaps might feel
for a woman &lsquo;the same preference that I do.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;This,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;will create no difficulty.&nbsp; We may all enjoy her
conversation; and we shall be wise enough to consider the sensual intercourse
as a very trivial object.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was impossible not to acknowledge
that the understanding often finds the problem rather abstruse of deciding
whether an action will or will not secure ultimately the largest balance
of happiness.&nbsp; Calvin was no fool, and yet he deliberately came
to the conclusion that in burning Servetus he was promoting the welfare
of mankind; but &lsquo;Calvin was unacquainted with the principles of
justice, and therefore could not practise them.&nbsp; The duty of no
man can exceed his capacity&rsquo; (i. 102).&nbsp; As to Godwin&rsquo;s
necessarianism, it is perhaps hardly worth while to cite passages in
order to explain it.&nbsp; It is of the usual type, incontrovertible
if the question is to be settled by common logic.&nbsp; &lsquo;Volition
is that state of an intellectual being in which, the mind being affected
in a certain manner by the apprehension of an end to be accomplished,
a certain motion of the organs and members of the animal frame is found
to be produced&rsquo; (i. 297).&nbsp; &lsquo;A knife has a capacity
of cutting.&nbsp; In the same manner a human being has a capacity of
walking, though it may be no more true of him than of the inanimate
substance, that he has the power of exercising or not exercising that
capacity&rsquo; (i. 308).&nbsp; &lsquo;A knife is as capable as a man
of being employed in the purposes of virtue, and the one is no more
free than the other as to its employment.&nbsp; The mode in which a
knife is made subservient to these purposes is by material impulse.&nbsp;
The mode in which a man is made subservient is by inducement and persuasion.&nbsp;
But both are equally the affair of necessity.&nbsp; The man differs
from the knife, just as the iron candlestick differs from the brass
one; he has one more way of being acted upon.&nbsp; This additional
way in man is motive, in the candlestick is magnetism&rsquo; (i. 309).</p>
<p>At first sight it is, as I have said, a wonder that Wordsworth should
have been much impressed by such doctrines as these, but the evidence
is strong that for a time they lay upon him like a nightmare.&nbsp;
I will not quote the <i>Borderers</i> for a reason which will be seen
presently, but the testimony of Hazlitt, Coleridge, the <i>Prelude</i>,
and the <i>Excursion</i> is decisive.&nbsp; &ldquo;Throw aside your
books of chemistry,&rdquo; said Wordsworth to a young man, a student
in the Temple, &ldquo;and read <i>Godwin on Necessity</i>&rdquo;&rsquo;
(Hazlitt&rsquo;s <i>Spirit of the Age</i>, p. 49, 3rd edition).&nbsp;
Now it is a question, important historically, but more important to
ourselves privately, whether Wordsworth&rsquo;s temporary subjugation
by <i>Political Justice</i> was due to pure intellectual conviction.&nbsp;
I think not.&nbsp; Coleridge noticed that Wordsworth suffered much from
hypochondria.&nbsp; He complains that during the Scotch tour in 1803
&lsquo;Wordsworth&rsquo;s hypochondriacal feelings keep him silent and
self-centred.&rsquo;&nbsp; He again says to Richard Sharp, in 1804,
that Wordsworth has &lsquo;occasional fits of hypochondriacal uncomfortableness,
from which, more or less, and at longer or shorter intervals, he has
never been wholly free from his very childhood,&rsquo; and that he has
a &lsquo;hypochondriacal graft in his nature.&rsquo;&nbsp; Wordsworth
himself speaks of times when -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo; . . . fears and fancies thick upon me came;<br />Dim sadness
- and blind thoughts, I knew not nor could name.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He is haunted with</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo; . . . the fear that kills,&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and he thinks of Chatterton and his end.</p>
<p>During 1793, 1794, and part of 1795, this tendency to hypochondria
must have been greatly encouraged.&nbsp; His hopes in the Revolution
had begun to fail, but the declaration of war against France made him
wretched.&nbsp; He wandered about from place to place, unable to conjecture
what his future would be.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been doing nothing,&rsquo;
he tells Matthews, &lsquo;and still continue to do nothing.&nbsp; What
is to become of me I know not.&rsquo;&nbsp; He proposed to start a Republican
magazine to be called the <i>Philanthropist</i>, and we find him inquiring
whether he could get work on the London newspapers.&nbsp; Hypochondriacal
misery is apt to take an intellectual shape.&nbsp; The most hopeless
metaphysics or theology which we happen to encounter fastens on us,
and we mistake for an unbiased conviction the form which the disease
assumes.&nbsp; The <i>Political Justice</i> found in Wordsworth the
aptest soil for germination; it rooted and grew rapidly.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;So I fared,<br />Dragging
all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds<br />Like culprits to the bar;
calling the mind,<br />Suspiciously, to establish in plain day<br />Her
titles and her honours; now believing,<br />Now disbelieving; endlessly
perplexed<br />With impulse, motive, right and wrong, the ground<br />Of
obligation, what the rule and whence<br />The sanction; till, demanding
formal <i>proof</i>,<br />And seeking it in everything, I lost<br />All
feeling of conviction, and, in fine,<br />Sick, wearied out with contrarieties,<br />Yielded
up moral questions in despair.<br />This was the crisis of that strong
disease,<br />This the soul&rsquo;s last and lowest ebb; I drooped,<br />Deeming
our blessed reason of least use<br />Where wanted most: &ldquo;The lordly
attributes<br />Of will and choice,&rdquo; I bitterly exclaimed,<br />&ldquo;What
are they but a mockery of a Being<br />Who hath in no concerns of his
a test<br />Of good and evil; knows not what to fear<br />Or hope for,
what to covet or to shun:<br />And who, if those could be discerned,
would yet<br />Be little profited, would see, and ask,<br />Where is
the obligation to enforce?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the autumn of 1795, Wordsworth, helped by the modest legacy of
Raisley Calvert, was able to move with Dorothy to Racedown, and he immediately
set to work on the <i>Borderers</i>, which I take to be the beginning
of recovery.&nbsp; It was obviously written to exhibit the character
of Oswald, the villain.&nbsp; He is one of a band of outlaws, and is
jealous of the appointment of Marmaduke as chief.&nbsp; His revenge
is a determination to make Marmaduke as guilty as himself.&nbsp; Marmaduke
is in love with Idonea, and Oswald, partly by inventing lies about her
blind father, Herbert, and partly by dexterous sophistry derived from
<i>Political Justice</i>, endeavours to persuade Marmaduke to kill him.&nbsp;
Marmaduke hesitates, but is finally overpowered.&nbsp; Although he cannot
himself murder Herbert, he draws him to a desolate moor and leaves him
to perish.&nbsp; Oswald then recounts his own story.&nbsp; When he was
on a voyage to Syria he had believed on false evidence, that some wrong
had been done to him by his captain, and accordingly contrived that
he should be left to die in agony on a barren island.&nbsp; Oswald discovered
that he had been deceived, but he declares exultantly to Marmaduke that,
after being somewhat stunned, he found himself emancipated:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Life stretched before me smooth as some broad way<br />Cleared
for a monarch&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp; Priests might spin<br />Their
veil, but not for me - &rsquo;twas in fit place<br />Among its kindred
cobwebs.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He concludes by avowing impudently that Herbert is innocent and that
the impulse which prompted the monstrous perfidy of procuring his death
was -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;I would have made us equal once again.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This is the commentary by Wordsworth on Godwin&rsquo;s parable by
which he illustrates the simplicity of action in what we call the soul.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When a ball upon a billiard-board is struck,&rsquo; etc. etc.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Exactly similar to this . . . are the actions of the human mind&rsquo;
(i. 306-7).&nbsp; Lacy, one of the freebooters asks Wallace:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;But for the motive?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and Wallace replies:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Natures such as his<br />Spin motives out
of their own bowels, Lacy!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The <i>Borderers</i> is stuffed full with Godwinism.&nbsp; &lsquo;Remorse,&rsquo;
exclaims Oswald,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot live with thought; think on, think on,<br />And
it will die.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; In this universe,<br />Where the least
things control the greatest, where<br />The faintest breath that breathes
can move a world;<br />What! feel remorse, where, if a cat had sneezed,<br />A
leaf had fallen, the thing had never been<br />Whose very shadow gnaws
us to the vitals.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>So Godwin: &lsquo;We shall, therefore, no more be disposed to repent
of our own faults than of the faults of others&rsquo; (i. 315).&nbsp;
The noxious thing is now, however, with Wordsworth no longer subject
but object, and when a man can cast loose the enemy and survey him,
victory is three parts achieved.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Wordsworth attempted any reasoned confutation
of <i>Political Justice</i>.&nbsp; It was falsified in him by Racedown,
by better health, by the society of his beloved sister, and finally
by the friendship with Coleridge, although there was but little intimacy
with him till the summer of 1797, and the <i>Borderers</i> was finished
in 1796.&nbsp; This, then, is the moral - to repeat what has been said
before - that certain beliefs, at any rate with men of Wordsworth&rsquo;s
stamp, are sickness, and that with the restoration of vitality and the
influx of joy they disappear.</p>
<p>One other observation.&nbsp; Wordsworth never afterwards vexed himself
with free will, necessity, and the like.&nbsp; He knew such matters
were not for him.&nbsp; Many problems may appear to be of great consequence,
but it is our duty to avoid them if our protecting genius warns us away.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>POSTSCRIPT</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The most singular portion of <i>Political Justice</i> is that which
deals with Population, and some notice of it, by way of postscript,
may be pardoned, for it cannot be neglected in our estimate of Godwin,
and it is a curious instance of the futility of attempting to comprehend
character without searching into corners and examination of facts which,
judged by external bulk, are small.&nbsp; These small facts may contain
principles which are constituent of the man.&nbsp; The chapter on Population
occupies a few pages at the end of the second volume of the <i>Political
Justice.</i></p>
<p>Godwin would like to see property equalised, or common, and he tries
to answer the argument that excessive population would ensue.&nbsp;
He quotes (ii. 862) a reported conjecture of Franklin&rsquo;s that &lsquo;mind
will one day become omnipotent over matter.&rsquo;&nbsp; If over matter,
which is outside us, thinks Godwin, why not over our own bodies, &lsquo;in
a word, why may not man be one day immortal&rsquo; (ii. 862).&nbsp;
He points out that the mind already has great power over the body, that
it can conquer pain, assist in the cure of disease, and successfully
resist old age.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why is it that a mature man soon loses that elasticity of
limb which characterises the heedless gaiety of youth?&nbsp; Because
he desists from youthful habits.&nbsp; He assumes an air of dignity
incompatible with the lightness of childish sallies.&nbsp; He is visited
and vexed with all the cares that rise out of our mistaken institutions,
and his heart is no longer satisfied and gay.&nbsp; Hence his limbs
become stiff and unwieldy.&nbsp; This is the forerunner of old age and
death&rsquo; (ii. 863-64).&nbsp; &lsquo;Medicine may reasonably be stated
to consist of two branches, the animal and intellectual.&nbsp; The latter
of these has been infinitely too much neglected&rsquo; (ii. 869).&nbsp;
We may look forward to a time when we shall be &lsquo;indifferent to
the gratifications of sense.&nbsp; They please at present by their novelty,
that is because we know not how to estimate them.&nbsp; They decay in
the decline of life indirectly because the system refuses them, but
directly and principally because they no longer excite the ardour and
passion of mind . . . The gratifications of sense please at present
by their imposture.&nbsp; We soon learn to despise the mere animal function,
which, apart from the delusions of intellect, would be nearly the same
in all cases; and to value it, only as it happens to be relieved by
personal charms or mental excellence.&nbsp; We absurdly imagine that
no better road can be found to the sympathy and intercourse of minds.&nbsp;
But a very slight degree of attention might convince us that this is
a false road, full of danger and deception.&nbsp; Why should I esteem
another, or by another be esteemed?&nbsp; For this reason only, because
esteem is due, and only so far as it is due.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The men therefore who exist when the earth shall refuse itself
to a more extended population will cease to propagate, for they will
no longer have any motive, either of error or duty, to induce them.&nbsp;
In addition to this they will perhaps be immortal.&nbsp; The whole will
be a people of men, and not of children.&nbsp; Generation will not succeed
generation, nor truth have in a certain degree to recommence her career
at the end of every thirty years.&nbsp; There will be no war, no crimes,
no administration of justice as it is called, and no government.&nbsp;
These latter articles are at no great distance; and it is not impossible
that some of the present race of men may live to see them in part accomplished.&nbsp;
But, besides this, there will be no disease, no anguish, no melancholy,
and no resentment.&nbsp; Every man will seek with ineffable ardour the
good of all&rsquo; (ii. 870-72).</p>
<p>A very curious vein, not golden indeed but copper, let us say, is
hidden away in the earthy mass of Godwin.&nbsp; The dull, heavy-featured
creature sees an apocalyptic vision and becomes poetical.&nbsp; It is
partly absurd, but not because it is ideal, and there are lineaments
in it of the true Utopia.&nbsp; Godwin probably would have denounced
the Revelation of St. John the Divine as superstitious nonsense, but
he saw before him a kind of misty, distorted reflection of the New Jerusalem,
in which there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain, where there shall be no more curse, no
night, no candle, no light of the sun.&nbsp; It might have been thought
that it was impossible to establish a connection between Patmos and
Skinner Street, but the first postulate of Euclid&rsquo;s elements holds
good universally, &lsquo;that a straight line may be drawn from any
one point to any other point.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whatever may be the meaning of the process of the world, however
disheartening some steps in its evolution may be, they are necessary,
and without them, perhaps, some evil could not thoroughly have been
worked out.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>People often manifest a diseased desire to express their will.&nbsp;
A theory is adopted, not because the facts force it upon them, but because
its adoption shows their power.&nbsp; The larger, the freer the nature,
the less there is of this action of the will, the more the mind is led.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A mere dream, a vague hope may be more potent than certainty in a
lesser matter.&nbsp; The faintest vision of God is more determinative
of life than a gross earthly certainty.</p>

<p>The more nearly the performer on a musical instrument approaches

<p>The highest education is that which teaches us to guide ourselves
by motives which are intangible, remote, incapable of direct and material

<p>Weak minds find confirmation of their beliefs in the discovery of
the same beliefs in other people.&nbsp; They do not take the trouble
to find out how their neighbours obtained these beliefs.&nbsp; If they
are current at the time, the probability is that the coincidence is
worthless as any evidence of validity.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The certainty which comes of intelligent conviction is a tempered
certainty.&nbsp; Its possessor knows the difficulty of the path by which
he has reached it, and the reasons which on his way have appeared so
potent against it.&nbsp; Fanaticism is the accompaniment of conclusions
which are not the result of reason.</p>

<p>The real object in any human being of my love and worship is that
which is not in any table of virtues, nor can I in any way describe
it: it is something which perpetually escapes, which is not to be found
in anything said or done.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It is a common mistake to demand a definition of that which can have
none.&nbsp; We loosely cover a mass of phenomena which are diverse with
a single word.&nbsp; For example, we puzzle over a definition of life,
but there is no such thing as life in the sense of a single, distinct
entity.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Religion has done harm by assigning an artificial urgency to insoluble
problems.&nbsp; We are all told that we must be certain on matters concerning
which the wisest man is ignorant.&nbsp; When we begin to reflect and
to doubt, the urgency unhappily remains and we are distressed.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I know a man who had to encounter three successive trials of all
the courage and inventive faculty in him.&nbsp; If he had failed in
one he would have been ruined.&nbsp; The odds were desperate against
him in each, and against ultimate victory were overwhelming.&nbsp; Nevertheless
he made the attempt and was triumphant almost by a miracle in each struggle.&nbsp;
How often calculation is folly and cowardice!</p>

<p>A negative may be really positive.&nbsp; It depends on the extent
of that which the negative excludes.&nbsp; If I say of hydrogen that
it is not oxygen, nothing is gained.&nbsp; If I say it is not a fluid
nor a solid, more is gained.&nbsp; So in the determinations of Spirit,
God, etc., although we use negatives, the results may be of value.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>True mental training is a discipline compelling us to <i>dwell</i>
on that which is presented to us, to discover what unites it to other
objects and what differentiates it from them.&nbsp; To the untrained
mind creation is a blur.&nbsp; The moral effect on a child of teaching
it to express distinction by significant words is great.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Ought&rsquo; is a singular instance of the confusion wrought
by words and of their inefficiency.&nbsp; There is no single &lsquo;ought&rsquo;
and therefore no science of the obligation it implies.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ought&rsquo;
in the phrase &lsquo;you ought to speak the truth&rsquo; refers to an
instinct in us to report veraciously what we see.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ought&rsquo;
of self-sacrifice refers to love, and &lsquo;ought&rsquo; of sobriety
to the subordination of desires, to a difference in their authority
of which we can give no account, excepting that we are creatures fashioned
in a certain way.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the presence of some people we inevitably depart from ourselves:

<p>There would be no objection to &lsquo;telling the truth&rsquo; about
Burns, Byron, and Shelley if it could be told.&nbsp; But it cannot be
told.&nbsp; We are informed that they did this or that, and the thing
they did is to us what it would be if done by ourselves.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We are most vain of that which is least ourselves, of that which

<p>Controversy is demoralising.&nbsp; Never suffer yourself to become

<p>To die is easy when we are in perfect health.&nbsp; On a fine spring

it would be nothing to lie down on the turf and pass away.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What we want is wise counsel on particular occasions.&nbsp; Principles
we can get by the bushel anywhere.&nbsp; The reason why our friends

<p>It is appalling to reflect that there are enormous masses of human
energy which can find no proper outlet.&nbsp; The consequence is mischief
either through expression in any direction and at any cost, or through
suppression.&nbsp; We want an organisation of energy, one of the noblest
offices of a true church.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The tyranny of the imagination is perhaps that which is most to be
dreaded.&nbsp; By strength of will we can prevent an act, but no strength
of will is able to prevent the invasion of self-created pictures.&nbsp;
The only remedies are health and indifference to them when they present
themselves.&nbsp; If we worry ourselves about them they become worse.&nbsp;
If we let them alone they fade and we forget them.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Thinking much upon insoluble problems is apt to breed superstition
even in the strongest minds.&nbsp; The failure of the reason weakens
our reliance on it, and the difference between the incomprehensible

<p>In this howling Bedlam of voices, it is of no use to talk or write
- no man, if he has anything to say, can be heard.&nbsp; He is reviewed
to-day and forgotten to-morrow.&nbsp; To soothe the pangs of a single
sufferer, to drain a poor man&rsquo;s cottage and give him wholesome
drinking water, are good things done of which we can be sure.</p>

<p>Life is a matter of small virtues, but we have to bring them to perfection.&nbsp;

<p>What a vile antithesis is that between a man and his faults!&nbsp;
If I love a man, I do not love his faults, for they are abstractions,
but I love the man <i>in</i> his faults.&nbsp; Are they not truly himself?&nbsp;
He is often more himself in his faults than in his virtues.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We should not talk as if we were responsible for the effect of what

<p><i>Wisdom for old age</i>. - Check the propensity to dwell on what
you have thought before.&nbsp; Try to get new ideas into your head.&nbsp;
Beware of giving trouble or asking for sympathy.&nbsp; Do everything
yourself, which you have been in the habit of doing, so long as you
can move a muscle, and when you cannot, secure, if possible, paid help:
watch what the most devoted of friends or relatives say of continued
attendance on the sick: note the relief when the sick man dies.&nbsp;
Let not the thought sadden you that six weeks after you are in your
grave those to whom you are now dear will be laughing and living just
as if you had never existed.&nbsp; Why should they not?&nbsp; Are you
of such consequence that they should for ever wear mourning for you?&nbsp;
A slow march as you are carried to the churchyard, but when a handful
of earth has been thrown on your coffin, let everybody go home to draw
up the blinds and open the windows.&nbsp; So much dead already, all
passion, so many capacities for enjoyment, why care for this miserable
residuum, this poor empty <i>I</i>?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Clear vision is not often the cause of distress.&nbsp; It is rather
the cloud of imagination distorting what is before us and preventing
distinct view.&nbsp; Science, removing the heavens to an infinite distance,
destroying traditions, abolishing our little theologies, does not disturb
our peace so seriously as that vague dreaming in which there is no thinking.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ah, it is not a quarrel which is so deadly!&nbsp; It is the strange
transformation of what were once thought to be charms and virtues.&nbsp;
The soft blue eyes are now simply silly; innocence is stupidity; docility
is incapacity of resolution; the sweet, even temper is absence of passion.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Is it true that less evidence is necessary to prove an event which
is probable than one that is improbable?&nbsp; The probability of an
event is no evidence that it actually happened.&nbsp; Its probability
may be the reason why we should examine the evidence more closely, because
witnesses are more likely, in the case of a probable event, to refrain
from scrutiny than in the case of one not probable.&nbsp; I sit at my
window and see a whitish object with four legs in a field.&nbsp; I am
short-sighted, but I at once say &lsquo;a cow,&rsquo; and take no pains
to ascertain whether it is a cow or not.&nbsp; If I had seen a white
object apparently with three legs only, I should have gone out, inspected
it closely, and should have called other people to look at it.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I pray for a gift which perhaps would be miraculous: simply to be
able to see that field of waving grass as I should see it if association

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Why do we admire intellect when it is united with even diabolic disregard
of moral laws?&nbsp; Partly because it stands out more prominently;
partly because it triumphs over obstacles; but mainly because we are
all more or less in sympathy with insurrection and the assertion of
individuality.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>As we move higher, personality becomes of less consequence.&nbsp;
We do not live in the &lsquo;I,&rsquo; but in truths.&nbsp; Something

<p>Principles are dangerous tools for a fool.&nbsp; What awful mischief

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Never was there a time in which men were less governed by ideas.&nbsp;
The Church and the sects are neither Calvinist nor Arminian, orthodox

<p>A decided bent or twist, is not unsuitable in a man, but I do not
care for it in a woman.&nbsp; I love that equipoise in the faces of
the Greek women in the old statues and sculptures.&nbsp; It appears
also in some pictures of the Virgin.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The duty of the State as to toleration cannot be decided by an appeal
to rights.&nbsp; Everybody admits that government is sometimes justified
in suppressing what is honestly believed.&nbsp; But if government had
not been resisted we should have had no Christianity.&nbsp; The vindication
of the authority of the State is a vindication of persecution, and if
we dispute this authority we cannot logically disallow dangerous licence.&nbsp;
There is no way out of the difficulty so long as we generalise.&nbsp;
Toleration is an abstraction, nothing but a word.&nbsp; What we have
to decide is, whether it is wise or unwise to send to prison the people
now before us who preach bigamy, assassination of kings, or theological
heresy.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>When we struggle to see more than we possibly can see we undervalue

<p>There is but little thinking, or perhaps it is more correct to say
but little reflection, in the Bible.&nbsp; There is profound sympathy
with a few truths, but ideas are not sought for their own sake.&nbsp;
Carlyle is Biblical.&nbsp; It has been said scoffingly that he is no
thinker.&nbsp; It is his glory that he is not.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What we have toiled after painfully often lies unused.&nbsp; No opportunity
occurs for saying or doing a tithe of it.&nbsp; The hour demands its

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>When we really love we cannot believe that our love is mortal.&nbsp;
We feel, not only that it is immortal, but that it is eternal, in the
sense in which Spinoza uses the word.&nbsp; It is not the attraction
of something entirely limited and personal to that which is also limited
and personal.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We think of rest as natural to bodies, and motion as something added.&nbsp;
But the new doctrine is that motion is primary.&nbsp; Nothing is at
rest, and, so far as we know, rest has never been.&nbsp; It is an astounding
conception.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There is a certain distance at which each person whom we know is
naturally placed from us.&nbsp; It varies with each, and we must not
attempt to alter it.&nbsp; We may clasp him who is close, and we are
not to pull closer him who is more remote.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Many people would be much better if they would let themselves be

<p>We are much misled by characters in fiction or on the stage, for
they are always more consistent than men and women in real life.&nbsp;
Real men and women are seldom controlled for twenty-four hours by the
same motives or principles.&nbsp; If my friend is mean to-day, let me
not doubt his generosity to-morrow.&nbsp; Let me joyously believe in
it when the morrow comes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What a pest is the re-appearance in us of discarded conclusions!&nbsp;
It would be of service if we could keep a register of those things which,
after careful examination, we have determined to be false.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Acting from the strongest motives, even if they are bad, is perhaps
not so dangerous as acting from none.&nbsp; The evils which arise through
deeds done from conspicuous motives attract attention, but the vast
sum of misery caused by mere idle, irresolute swaying hither and thither
passes unnoticed.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Pig-headedness is often a sign of weakness of will.&nbsp; The pig-headed
person knows he is weak, and to convince himself and others of his resolution
holds to any chance purpose with tenacity.&nbsp; The less reasonable
the purpose is, the more obstinately he clings to it, because, by so
doing, he shows as he thinks his strength of volition.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>If we desire peace we must get beyond the notion of personality.&nbsp;
Nothing of any value is bound up with it: it is an illusion.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Intense feeling gives intellectual precision.&nbsp; The man who feels
profoundly the beauty of a cloud is the man who can describe it.&nbsp;
But the first effect of intense feeling is often to break up false precision.&nbsp;
The ideas of God, life, personality, right and wrong, are examples.</p>

<p>The blue sky is more beautiful because we know it is not painted
opacity, but transparent.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>

<p><i>June</i> - Sky and sea pure blue.&nbsp; The blue tint suffuses

<p>It is not true that guileless people are the most easily deceived.&nbsp;
S. G. is not sharp-witted, but she is transparent as a pool of rain

ridiculous to attempt it: her eyes forbid it.&nbsp; She does not infer
insincerity: it is automatically rejected.</p>

<p><i>July</i>. - North-easterly wind, strong: hateful in the streets

A perfect day for that view.&nbsp; The bay all shades of blue; here
and there deep, and, inshore, the blue is broken with pure white from
the tops of the waves: the yellow beach to the farthest point clasping
the sea like an arm.&nbsp; So beautiful that it gives pain: it is not
possible to extend oneself to it.</p>

<p>The Athanasian Creed is not objectionable because of its damnatory
clauses.&nbsp; Neglect to observe the finest distinctions continually
involves damnation.&nbsp; The difference between a vice and a virtue
may be a hair-line.&nbsp; The true reason for rejecting the Creed is
that it is manufactured, that it is not a statement of what is seen
and felt to be true.&nbsp; There is nevertheless a certain dogmatic
pride in it, a desire to affirm as offensively as possible.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And thy fats shall overflow with new wine&rsquo; - Proverbs
iii. 10, Revised Version.&nbsp; Called on A. in London.&nbsp; I forget
how it came about, but in course of conversation he asked me if &lsquo;fats&rsquo;
were not a mistake for &lsquo;vats.&rsquo;&nbsp; I told him it was not,
turning up the word in the dictionary as an equivalent to &lsquo;vats.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Called on his sister, who was staying three or four miles away and had
come up to town that afternoon from the country where she lived.&nbsp;
That very evening she asked me the same question her brother had asked.&nbsp;
She had not seen him, nor held any communication with him on the subject,
nor had it been suggested to them by any person or book.&nbsp; Moreover,
neither of them is a frequent reader of the Bible.&nbsp; Yesterday I
told the story to A. in his sister&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; She confirmed
it, and A., who is accustomed to scientific investigation, was quite
unable to account for it.&nbsp; If a jury were trying a prisoner charged
with murder, and an equally singular concurrence of circumstances were
in evidence against him, they would not hesitate to hang him.</p>

sunset, the whole south-western sky has blazed up, passing from glowing
flame-colour on the horizon to carmine on the zenith.&nbsp; Between
the promontories of cloud are lakes and gulfs of the tenderest green

be a ball and that it should turn on its axis.&nbsp; But just as surely
was it the design or law that there should be these colours, crimson,

They read the best books, and do not read those which are bad.&nbsp;
Some friends were there, and I was entertained with intelligent criticism
of literature, music, and pictures, and learned much that was worth
knowing.&nbsp; But I came away unsatisfied, and rather dazed.&nbsp;
On my way back - it was a singularly warm, clear evening in February
- I turned in to see an old lady who lives near me.&nbsp; She was sitting
wrapped up at her wide-open window, looking at the light that was still

not take cold.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;I often
sit here, and so long as I keep myself warm I come to no harm.&nbsp;
I cannot read by candlelight, and I am thankful that this room faces
the south.&nbsp; I know the stars much better than when I was young.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I took the chair beside her, and for ten minutes neither of us spoke,
but I was not conscious for an instant of the disagreeable feeling that
silence must be broken, and search be made for something with which
to break it.&nbsp; If two persons are friends in the best sense of the
word, they are not uncomfortable if they do not talk when they are together.&nbsp;
Presently she told me that she had received news that morning of the
birth of a granddaughter.&nbsp; She was much pleased.&nbsp; The mother
already had two sons and desired a girl.&nbsp; I stayed for about half
an hour, and went home in debt to her for peace.</p>

<p>Bacon observes that whatever the mind seizes and dwells upon with
peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion.&nbsp; Naturally so,
because it is nearly certain to be something merely personal to ourselves.</p>

<p>Excepting in one word, the betrayal of Jesus, the defection of Peter,
the examination before Pilate and Herod, and the crucifixion, are recorded,
as Spedding notices, without any vituperation.&nbsp; The excepted word,
not named by Spedding, is &lsquo;blasphemously&rsquo; (Luke xxii. 65).

are also right through being wrong.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When he is moderate and regular in any of these things, out
of a sense of Christian sobriety and self-denial, that he may offer
unto God a more reasonable and holy life, then it is, that the smallest
rule of this kind is naturally the beginning of great piety.&nbsp; For
the smallest rule in these matters is of great benefit, as it teaches
us some part of the government of ourselves, as it keeps up a tenderness
of mind, as it presents God often to our thoughts, and brings a sense
of religion into the ordinary actions of our common life.&rsquo; - (Law&rsquo;s
<i>Serious Call</i>.)&nbsp; Men are restrained by fear of consequences,
but it is Law&rsquo;s rule which gives strength and dignity.&nbsp; Living
in a certain way because Perfection demands it produces a result different
from that obtained by living in the same way through fear of injury
to health.</p>

<p>Man is the revelation of the Infinite, and it does not become finite

<p>Luther says somewhere, &lsquo;Do not anxiously search for the pillars

searched for the pillars.&nbsp; There are none, and yet the sky will
not fall.</p>

<p>There is a great reserve of incomprehensibility in all the few friends

<p>Bacon observes that &lsquo;interpretations&rsquo; of Nature, that
is to say real generalisations elicited from facts by a just and methodical
process, &lsquo;cannot suddenly strike the understanding&rsquo; like
&lsquo;anticipations&rsquo; collected from a few instances.&nbsp; I
have often noticed that &lsquo;striking&rsquo; is seldom a sign of truth,
and that those things which are most true, the Sermon on the Mount and
the Parables for example, do not &lsquo;strike.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We foolishly exaggerate ingratitude to us.&nbsp; Ought we to require

<p>The worship of the idol is often more passionate than that of God.&nbsp;

<p><i>Plus sapit vulgus, quia tantum, quantum opus est, sapit</i>. <a name="citation254"></a><a href="#footnote254">{254}</a>&nbsp;

of Montaigne and true, so far that a man can know nothing thoroughly

<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;Certainty of knowledge,&rsquo; says Dr. Johnson in the
<i>Idler</i> (No. 84), &lsquo;not only excludes mistake, but fortifies
veracity. . . .&nbsp; That which is fully known cannot be falsified
but with reluctance of understanding, and alarm of conscience: of understanding,
the lover of truth; of conscience, the sentinel of virtue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the present day we are chiefly taken up with that which is beyond
our grasp.&nbsp; Our literature is the newspapers, and nine-tenths of
what we read in them morning and evening we do not understand.&nbsp;
Everybody is expected to take sides in politics, but not one person
in a thousand can give an intelligible account of political questions.&nbsp;
The difficulty of so doing is much increased by the absence of systematic
information.&nbsp; We get leading articles and columns of telegrams,
but seldom concise exposition or carefully edited and connected history.</p>
<p>An object is of importance to us in inverse proportion to the square
of the distance, but men worry themselves about the news from China
and will not give five minutes&rsquo; thought in a week to their own
souls or to those of wife or child.&nbsp; It is pathetic to see how
excited they become about remote events which cannot affect their happiness
one iota.&nbsp; Why should we not occupy ourselves with that which is
definite when there is so much of it?&nbsp; Political problems confront
us, but if they are too big for us, let us avoid them by every means
in our power.&nbsp; If we are in doubt we ought not to vote.&nbsp; The
question which we are incapable of settling will be settled better by
Time than by the intermeddling of ignorance.</p>
<p>In religion, and science also, we dare not say <i>I do not know</i>.&nbsp;
We must always be dabbling in matters on which we can come to no conclusion
worth a rotten nut.&nbsp; We busy ourselves with essays on the dates
and composition of the books of the Old Testament and cannot tell the
story of Joshua or Saul; we listen to lectures on radium, or the probable
exhaustion of the sun&rsquo;s energy, and have never learned the laws
of motion.&nbsp; Few people estimate properly the evil of habitual intercourse
with that which is vague and indeterminate.&nbsp; The issues before
us not being clearly cut and comprehensible, the highest faculties of
our minds are not exercised.&nbsp; We lazily wander over the surface
without coming to a definite conclusion.&nbsp; Perhaps we pick up by
chance some irrational notion, which we defend with obstinacy, for we
are more dogmatic concerning that which we cannot prove than we are
concerning a truth which is incontrovertible.&nbsp; The former is our
own personal property, the latter is common.&nbsp; One step further,
and by constantly affirming and denying when we have no demonstration,
lying becomes easy.</p>
<p>There is much which is called criticism that is poisonous, not because
it is mistaken, but because it invites people to assert beyond their
knowledge or capacity.&nbsp; A popular lecturer discusses the errors
of Sir Walter Scott, Charlotte Bronte, or George Eliot before an audience
but superficially acquainted with the works of these great authors and
not qualified to pass judgment upon them.&nbsp; He is considered &lsquo;cheap&rsquo;
if he does not balance</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;His wit all see-saw between that and this,<br />Now high,
now low, now master up, now miss.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>If we will be content with admiring, we are on much surer ground.&nbsp;
It is by admiration and not by criticism that we live, and the main
purpose of criticism should be to point out something to admire, which
we should not have noticed.&nbsp; One great advantage of studying Nature
is that we are not tempted to criticise her.&nbsp; We go to the Academy,
and for a whole morning contrast faults with merits.&nbsp; If the time
so spent had been passed in the fields with the clouds we should have
gone home less conceited.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It is an awful thought that behind human speech, incapable by its

<p>The long apprenticeship has ended in little or nothing.&nbsp; What

<p>I have been looking at a cabinet of flies.&nbsp; Hundreds of them,
each different, were arranged in order and named.&nbsp; Some I had to
examine through a microscope.&nbsp; Their beauty was marvellous, but
more marvellous was their variety.&nbsp; The differences, although the
type was preserved, seemed inexhaustible, and all reasons for them broke
down.&nbsp; If a particular modification is an advantage, why is it
confined to one species?&nbsp; Why this range of colour?&nbsp; Why these
purely fantastic forms?&nbsp; The only word we can say with certainty
is that Nature is infinite and tends to infinite expression.&nbsp; <i>Verum
ego me satis clare ostendisse puto, a summa Dei potentia sive infinita
natura infinita infinitis modis, hoc est, omnia necessario effluxisse,
vel semper eadem necessitate sequi; eodem modo, ac ex natura trianguli
ab &aelig;terno et in &aelig;ternum sequitur ejus tres angulos &aelig;quari

<p>Johnson is religious through and through, but there are passages
in the <i>Rambler</i> and <i>Idler</i> dark as starless, moonless midnight.&nbsp;
&lsquo;None would have recourse to an invisible power, but that all
other subjects have eluded their hopes . . .&nbsp; That misery does
not make all virtuous, experience too certainly informs us; but it is
no less certain that of what virtue there is, misery produces far the
greatest part.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There is seldom in life any occasion for great virtues, and we must
not be disappointed if it passes without great passion.&nbsp; We must

<p>With increase of reading we have fallen into a fireside, dilettante
culture of ideas as an intellectual pleasure.&nbsp; Amos and Isaiah
do not deal in ideas.&nbsp; Their strength lies in love and hatred,
in the keenness and depth of their division between right and wrong.&nbsp;
They repeat the work of God the Creator: chaotic sameness becomes diverse;
the heavenly firmament mounts on high; there is Light and there is Darkness.</p>

<h2>SHAKESPEARE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Glory to thee in the highest, thou confidant of our Creator!&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Landor, <i>Imaginary Conversations</i>, Delille and Landor).</p>
<p>2 <i>Henry VI</i>. iii. 3. - The lines beginning with the one which
follows are not in the old play and are Shakespeare&rsquo;s own:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;O thou eternal Mover of the heavens,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s note is: &lsquo;This is one of the scenes which have
been applauded by the criticks, and which will continue to be admired
when prejudices shall cease, and bigotry give way to impartial examination.&nbsp;
These are beauties that rise out of nature and of truth; the superficial
reader cannot miss them, the profound can image nothing beyond them.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We talk idly of Johnson&rsquo;s pompous redundance.&nbsp; His sentences
are balanced, and it is therefore supposed that the second part repeats
the first, but the truth is that each part contains a new thought.&nbsp;
It was his manner to throw successive ideas into this form.&nbsp; Those
who are acquainted with his history and his awful mental struggles will
find infinite pathos in this restrained comment.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>. - Shakespeare&rsquo;s overlooking
quality, as that of a god surveying human affairs, is shown in this
play:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;When they next wake, all this derision<br />Shall seem a dream
and fruitless vision.&rsquo;<br />. . .<br />&lsquo;Her dotage now I
do begin to pity.&rsquo;<br />. . .<br />&lsquo;And think no more of
this night&rsquo;s accidents<br />But as the fierce vexation of a dream.&rsquo;<br />.

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. - The love of Juliet is a thing altogether
by itself, not to be classed, never anticipated by any other author,
and not imitable.&nbsp; It is sensuous.&nbsp; Look at her soliloquy,
&lsquo;Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,&rsquo; etc., and yet it
is woven through and through with immortal threads of fidelity and contempt
of death:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;O! bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br />From off the
battlements of yonder tower.<br />. . .<br />Or bid me go into a new-made
grave.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>How great this girl is!&nbsp; If I were to meet her, how I should
be awed!&nbsp; The Juliets I have seen on the stage fail here.&nbsp;
They do not bend my knees in that adoration which is inspired by the
sea and stars.&nbsp; The love of Romeo for Juliet and of Juliet for
Romeo does not stimulate passion, but rather controls it.&nbsp; I never
become hot in reading the play.&nbsp; What a solemnity there is in its
movement!&nbsp; The lovers are not merely two human beings with no other
meaning.&nbsp; The Eternal Powers are at work throughout.&nbsp; Romeo&rsquo;s
love for Rosaline is taken over from Brooke&rsquo;s poem.&nbsp; Shakespeare
adds the touch that it was not genuine.&nbsp; He makes Friar Laurence
say:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;O she knew well!<br />Thy love did read
by rote, and could not spell.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The love for Rosaline is different altogether from the love for Juliet.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;O heavy lightness! serious vanity!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>is artificial.</p>
<p>Shakespeare also follows Brooke in Juliet&rsquo;s momentary outburst
against Romeo when she hears of Tybalt&rsquo;s death, but the contradiction
of the echo by the nurse is Shakespeare&rsquo;s own:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Blister&rsquo;d be thy tongue<br />For such
a wish! he was not born to shame.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Apart from the quarrel between the Montagus and Capulets, we feel
that the love between Romeo and Juliet could have no other than a tragic
end.&nbsp; This world of ours conspires against such passion.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I <i>Henry IV</i>. v. 4 -</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Harry, thou hast robb&rsquo;d me of my youth!<br />I better
brook the loss of brittle life<br />Than those proud titles thou hast
won of me;<br />They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh:<br />But
thought&rsquo;s the slave of life, and life time&rsquo;s fool;<br />And
time, that takes survey of all the world,<br />Must have a stop.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The last three lines are not melancholy philosophising.&nbsp; As
such they would be out of place coming from Hotspur.&nbsp; They are
consolation and joy.&nbsp; Death will extinguish for us the memory of
certain things suffered and done.&nbsp; That is a gain which is not
outweighed by the loss of any pleasure life can give.</p>
<p>Luders&rsquo; essay three parts of a century ago showed conclusively
that Holinshed&rsquo;s and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Prince of Wales, as we
see him in the play of <i>Henry IV</i>., wild and dissolute with ignoble
companions, is a legend which is disproved by documentary history, but
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Prince is nevertheless dramatically true.&nbsp;
Johnson says, &lsquo;He is great without effort, and brave without tumult.&nbsp;
The trifler is roused into a hero, and the hero again reposes in the
trifler.&nbsp; The character is great, original, and just.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Johnson&rsquo;s criticism is true.&nbsp; There is no interruption or
strain in the passage from one self to the other self: they are both
in fact the same self.&nbsp; It is something of a shock that the King
should cast off Falstaff, but if a man is appointed to command it is
necessary that he should at once take up his proper position.&nbsp;
I remember the promotion of a subordinate to a responsible post.&nbsp;
His manner changed the next day.&nbsp; He had the courage to ring his
bell and give orders to his senior under whom he had been serving.</p>
<p>He became one of the most efficient administrators I ever knew.&nbsp;
On the other hand, nearly at the same time another subordinate was promoted
who was timid and continued his habits of familiarity with his colleagues.&nbsp;
His department fell into disorder and he was dismissed.</p>

<p><i>As You Like It</i>. - Lady Anne Blunt in her admirable books,
<i>A Pilgrimage to Nejd</i> and <i>The Bedouin Tribes of the Euphrates</i>,
notices that the true Arab sheykh of the desert, when a traveller seeks
his hospitality, asks no questions until food and drink have been offered,
and even then is in no hurry.&nbsp; So also the Duke:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Welcome, fall to: I will not trouble you<br />As yet, to question
you about your fortunes.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Curiosity about personal matters is ignoble.</p>
<p>Rosalind&rsquo;s love for Orlando is born of pity.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed,
but one dead that is willing to be so: I shall do my friends no wrong,
for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have
nothing; only in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied
when I have made it empty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is a proof of Orlando&rsquo;s gentle breeding that he instantly
yields to courtesy:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Speak you so gently?&nbsp; Pardon me, I pray you.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Orlando says to Jaques: &lsquo;I will chide no breather in the world,
but myself, against whom I know most faults.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is characteristic
of Shakespeare, and is in the spirit of the Gospels.</p>
<p>The difficulty in this play is not Oliver&rsquo;s sudden love for
Celia, although Shakespeare seems to have felt that it was a little
too rapid, for Orlando asks Oliver, &lsquo;Is&rsquo;t possible that
on so little acquaintance you should like her?&rsquo;&nbsp; It is rather
Celia&rsquo;s prompt response which takes us aback.&nbsp; It looks too
much like &lsquo;any woman to any man.&rsquo;&nbsp; It may be said in
excuse that Celia had heard the piteous story of his conversion, how
he had become &lsquo;a wretched ragged man o&rsquo;ergrown with hair,&rsquo;
and what is more to the point, she had heard of Orlando&rsquo;s noble
kindness to him.&nbsp; It is odd that Shakespeare does not adopt from
Lodge&rsquo;s novel Oliver&rsquo;s rescue of Celia from a band of ruffians.&nbsp;
Johnson says, &lsquo;To Celia much may be forgiven for the heroism of
her friendship.&rsquo;&nbsp; She forsook not only her father - she had
reason not to care much about him - but she forsook the <i>court</i>
for Rosalind.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>. - Why should Don Pedro offer to take
Claudio&rsquo;s place in the wooing of Hero and why should Claudio consent?</p>
<p>Borachio says, &lsquo;Hear me call Margaret, Hero; hear Margaret
call me Claudio.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Borachio recounts to Conrad what he had done, he makes no mention
of his personation of Claudio - &lsquo;Know, that I have to-night wooed
Margaret, the lady Hero&rsquo;s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero; she
leans me out at her mistress&rsquo;s chamber-window, bids me a thousand
times good night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Theobald remarks that if Claudio saw another man with the woman supposed
to be Hero and heard her call him Claudio, Claudio would merely suppose
that Hero was deceived.&nbsp; Theobald proposes to substitute &lsquo;Borachio&rsquo;
for &lsquo;Claudio&rsquo; in the line just quoted.&nbsp; Borachio had
just asked Don John to tell Don Pedro and Claudio that Hero loved him,
Borachio.&nbsp; But if Theobald&rsquo;s emendation be received, difficulties
still remain.&nbsp; Margaret must have been persuaded to answer to the
name of Hero.&nbsp; After Borachio&rsquo;s arrest he tells us that Margaret
wore Hero&rsquo;s garments.&nbsp; But Shakespeare, deserting Spenser,
from whom this mystification appears to be borrowed, gives no reason
which induced Margaret to play this part.</p>
<p>Where was Hero on that night?&nbsp; Borachio promises Don John that
&lsquo;he will so fashion the matter, that Hero shall be absent.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Claudio asks Hero</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;What man was he talk&rsquo;d with you yesternight<br />Out
at your window betwixt twelve and one?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>She does not reply, as we should think she would, that she was not
sleeping in that room, although Benedick asks Beatrice,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and Beatrice replies,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;No, truly not; although until last night,<br />I have this
twelvemonth been her bedfellow.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Claudio is despicable, and his marriage with Hero is a foul, black
spot in the play.&nbsp; Observe that in the first scene he asks Don
Pedro,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Hath Leonato any son, my lord?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and Don Pedro, understanding the drift of the question, replies:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;No child but Hero, she&rsquo;s his only heir.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What a mean, damnable excuse he makes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yet sinn&rsquo;d I not,<br />But in mistaking.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Beatrice with sure eye discerns the scoundrel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kill
Claudio.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not Don Pedro, not even Don John, although she
had heard Benedick denounce him as the author of the villainy.</p>
<p>Beatrice and the Friar never doubt Hero&rsquo;s innocence.&nbsp;
The Friar declares that</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;In her eye there hath appear&rsquo;d a fire<br />To burn the
errors that these princes hold<br />Against her maiden truth.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What an amplitude there is in Beatrice!&nbsp; What a sweep it is
to bring into what we already know of her such divine faith in her friend!&nbsp;
This light-hearted girl suddenly becomes sublime.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Hamlet</i>. - Coleridge&rsquo;s remark that the two former appearances
of the Ghost increase its objectivity when it appears to Hamlet is subtle
and true.&nbsp; Observe that the Ghost is visible to Hamlet, Marcellus,
Bernardo and Horatio, but not to the Queen.</p>
<p>There is in Coleridge an activity of intellect which is so fascinating
that we do not stay to inquire whether the result is in accordance with
the facts.&nbsp; He says that <i>t&aelig;dium vit&aelig;</i> as in the
case of Hamlet is due to &lsquo;unchecked appetency of the ideal.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Was the appetency of the ideal strong in Hamlet?&nbsp; The ideal exalts
our interest in earthly things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now might I do it pat, now he is praying.&rsquo;&nbsp; Johnson
says that this speech, in which Hamlet contrives damnation for the man
he would punish, is too horrible to be read or to be uttered; whereupon
Coleridge remarks that Hamlet&rsquo;s postponement of revenge till it
should bring damnation to soul as well as body &lsquo;was merely the
excuse Hamlet made to himself for not taking advantage of this particular
and favourable moment for doing justice upon his guilty uncle, at the
urgent instance of the spirit of his father.&rsquo;&nbsp; I doubt if
this is a complete explanation.&nbsp; Would it strike the audience as
the motive?&nbsp; Men of Hamlet&rsquo;s mould not only speak but feel
extravagantly.&nbsp; Incapacity for prompt action is accompanied with
more intense emotion than that which is felt by him who acts at once.&nbsp;
Hamlet meditates on revenge instead of executing it, and his desire,
by brooding, becomes diabolic.</p>
<p>Generalisations like those of Polonius are obtained from observation
during youth and middle age.&nbsp; In old age the creation of generalisations
ceases and we fall back on our acquired stock.&nbsp; They remain true,
but the application fails.&nbsp; We must be increasingly careful in
the use of these ancient abstractions, and more intent on the consideration
of the instance before us.&nbsp; The temptation to drag it under what
we already know is great and must be resisted.&nbsp; Proverbs and wise
saws are more suitable to common life than to intricate relationships.&nbsp;
They are inapplicable to deep passion and spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Johnson notes that the Ghost&rsquo;s visits are a failure so far
as Hamlet&rsquo;s resolution is concerned.</p>
<p>Hamlet says,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;O! from this time forth,<br />My thoughts
be bloody, or be nothing worth!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>but they remained thoughts.&nbsp; The play is to be the thing to
decide him, but when it is over and he has the clearest proofs, he does
not act, but consents to leave Denmark and returns by accident.&nbsp;
Had he obeyed the Ghost&rsquo;s promptings and killed the King at the
end of the play in the third act, Polonius, Ophelia, the Queen, Laertes,
and Hamlet himself might have been saved.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Troilus and Cressida</i> is an inexplicable play.&nbsp; It is
a justification of those critics who obstinately, but without external
evidence, refuse to believe that much which is attributed to Shakespeare
really belongs to him.&nbsp; It is absolutely impossible that the man
who put these words into the mouth of Achilles:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I have a woman&rsquo;s longing,<br />An
appetite that I am sick withal,<br />To see great Hector in his weeds
of peace;<br />To talk with him, and to behold his visage,<br />Even
to my full of view.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>could have adapted from the <i>Recuyell</i> the shocking ignominy
of the ninth scene in the fifth act in which Achilles calls on his myrmidons
to slay Hector unarmed, and then triumphs in these lines:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;My half-supp&rsquo;d sword, that frankly would have fed,<br />Pleas&rsquo;d
with this dainty bit, thus goes to bed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Sheathes
his sword</i>.<br />Come, tie his body to my horse&rsquo;s tail;<br />Along
the field I will the Trojan trail.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Measure for Measure</i> as a play is hateful to me, although there
are passages in it as truly Shakespeare as anything to be found in all
his works.&nbsp; The chief objection to it is that justice, to use Coleridge&rsquo;s
word, is &lsquo;baffled.&rsquo;&nbsp; There are other objections almost
as great.&nbsp; From beginning to end almost everybody is base, foolish,
or uninteresting.&nbsp; The Duke&rsquo;s temporary withdrawal is stupid
and contemptible, considering that he is the governor of the state;
the condemnation of Claudio is wildly unnatural; the substitution of
Mariana loathsome; the treachery of Angelo in not reprieving Claudio
inconceivable, notwithstanding what we already know of the deputy&rsquo;s
hypocrisy and villainy.&nbsp; The lowest depth of scoundrelism is reached
when, face to face with Mariana and publicly at the city gate before
the Duke and all the company assembled, he excuses himself from marrying
her because</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;her reputation was disvalued<br />In levity.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And yet he is let off scot-free, and Mariana marries him!&nbsp; Isabella&rsquo;s
apology,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I partly think,<br />A due sincerity govern&rsquo;d
his deeds,<br />Till he did look on me,&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>might be sufficient for an outbreak of his lust but not for his lying,
and Mariana&rsquo;s is still worse:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Best men are moulded out of faults.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Not out of such faults as Angelo&rsquo;s are the best men moulded.</p>
<p>The punishment inflicted on the poor wretch Lucio is horrible.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Lucio</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I beseech your highness, do not marry
me to a whore! . . . Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
whipping and hanging.</p>
<p><i>Duke</i>.&nbsp; Slandering a prince deserves it.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This is a foul line.&nbsp; I should like to discover documentary
proof that it is not Shakespeare&rsquo;s, but the gag of some actor
desirous of pleasing court folk</p>
<p>The <i>Promos and Cassandra</i> from which <i>Measure for Measure</i>
is taken is certainly worse, for Promos (Angelo) is made to marry Cassandra
(Isabella) and after the marriage is to die, but Cassandra, &lsquo;tyed
in the greatest bondes of affection to her husband, becomes an earnest
suter for his life.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Henry VIII</i>. - The scene in which Katherine appears before
the court is perhaps the finest in the play.&nbsp; To what noble use
is her Spanish pride turned!&nbsp; The last line of the following quotation
from Katherine&rsquo;s reply to Wolsey is infinite:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For it is you<br />Have blown this coal
betwixt my lord and me,<br />Which God&rsquo;s dew quench.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Othello</i> is pure tragedy, for the judgment which falls on Othello
and Desdemona, although it is disproportionate to the character or life
of either, is necessary from the beginning.&nbsp; Brabantio was not
wholly without justification in thinking the marriage unnatural, and
Desdemona&rsquo;s desertion of him without a word was unfeeling.&nbsp;
The depth of the tragedy is increased by his death.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Desdemon I am glad thy father&rsquo;s dead.<br />Thy
match was mortal to him.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Iago feels the necessity of obtaining motives for his conduct.&nbsp;
He tries to find them in the supposed infidelity of his wife with Othello
and in his supersession by Cassio.&nbsp; Neither is sufficient, but
he partly believes in them, and they partly serve their purpose.</p>
<p>Coleridge says Othello was not jealous: he lacked the suspicion that
is essential to jealousy.&nbsp; Perhaps so, but in that case we want
a name for the passion which rushes to belief of that which it prays
may be false.&nbsp; The very intensity of love, so far from inducing
careful examination of slander against the divinity I worship, prevents
reflection by anxiety; by terror lest the love should be disturbed.&nbsp;
Iago&rsquo;s evidence, thinks Coleridge, was so strong that Othello
could not have done otherwise; but would he have acted in war on evidence
equally weak?</p>
<p>How mad Iago is with all his cunning!&nbsp; What a fool!&nbsp; Had
he been anything but the maddest fool, he would have seen that in the
end his plans must break down.&nbsp; Intellect?&nbsp; Yes, of a kind
he had it pre-eminently, but intellect becomes folly when it is inhuman.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Shakespeare might have made Othello the more eager to plunge into
the big wars, but Desdemona is so inwoven with him that the whole fabric
goes to ruin when she is torn out.</p>
<p>Othello &lsquo;falls in a trance&rsquo; after his outburst at the
beginning of the fourth act.&nbsp; He is a Moor.&nbsp; In the background
also lies Brabantio&rsquo;s prophecy.&nbsp; Venice cannot do without
him, but he cannot hold a Venetian woman.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>King Lear</i>. - There are passages in <i>King Lear</i> which
are enough to make us wish we had never been born.&nbsp; They are almost
an impeachment of the Ruler of the Universe, and yet - there is Cordelia.&nbsp;
Whence did she come?&nbsp; She is as much His handiwork as Regan, and
in all our conclusions about Him we must take her into account.</p>
<p>Lear does not go mad.&nbsp; He is mad from the beginning, but his
madness is in abeyance.&nbsp; Look at the style of his curses on Goneril.</p>
<p>Coleridge&rsquo;s criticism is exact: &lsquo;Lear&rsquo;s self-supportless
leaning for all pleasure on another&rsquo;s breast.&rsquo;&nbsp; If
a man desires not to go mad or not to be soured into oil of vitriol,
let him watch the doors of his heart; let him never solicit any expression
of love.</p>
<p>Cordelia&rsquo;s &lsquo;nothing, my lord,&rsquo; as Coleridge says,
is partly irrepressible disgust at her sisters&rsquo; hypocrisy.&nbsp;
There was also, as France admits, &lsquo;a tardiness in nature&rsquo;
in Cordelia.&nbsp; She was her father&rsquo;s favourite, but what sort
of a life must she have lived with such a father before the time at
which the play opens?&nbsp; We ought not to be surprised that she refuses
to be demonstrative.&nbsp; She reacts against his exaggeration.</p>
<p>I cannot read the blinding of Gloucester.&nbsp; The only excuse that
can be offered, not good for much, is that Shakespeare found the story
in the <i>Arcadia</i>, and that in his day horrors on the stage were
not so repulsive as they are to us.&nbsp; Cordelia&rsquo;s death taken
from Holinshed is almost as bad.&nbsp; It is not involved in the tragedy
like the death of Ophelia or of Desdemona.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>All&rsquo;s Well that Ends Well</i>. - Johnson comments, &lsquo;I
cannot reconcile my heart to Bertram; a man noble without generosity,
and young without truth; who married Helena as a coward, and leaves
her as a profligate: when she is dead by his unkindness, sneaks home
to a second marriage, is accused by a woman whom he has wronged, defends
himself by falsehood, and is dismissed to happiness.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
is just.&nbsp; Bertram is atrocious.&nbsp; With Helena before him he
says,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,<br />I&rsquo;ll
love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Did he require a deposition on oath in presence of a magistrate?&nbsp;
He deserved a scourging in the market place.</p>
<p>Coleridge calls Helena one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s loveliest women.&nbsp;
I cannot agree.&nbsp; She secures her husband&rsquo;s embraces under
a false pretence.&nbsp; How a woman could consent to lie in the arms
of a man who had cast her off, and who believed when he was enjoying
her that she was a mistress whom he preferred is beyond my comprehension.&nbsp;
It is so in Boccaccio, but that is no excuse.&nbsp; Devotion to a man
who is indifferent or who hates, is tragically possible, but in its
greatest intensity would hardly permit such humiliation.</p>
<p>The play is bad altogether.&nbsp; What was the necessity for suggesting
Bertram&rsquo;s second marriage?&nbsp; There is nowhere any trace of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s depth.&nbsp; The difficulties of the text are singular,
and seem to mark this drama as one different from the rest.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Macbeth</i>. - Johnson&rsquo;s remark that the events are so great
that they overpower the persons and prevent nice discrimination of character
is partly true.</p>
<p>Coleridge notices that Lady Macbeth was a person of high rank, living
much alone.&nbsp; A darkly meditative mind left in solitude can conceive
without being startled the most awful designs.&nbsp; The same imagination
in Lady Macbeth which brooded over the plot against Duncan&rsquo;s life
drove her to delirium and suicide.</p>
<p>Shakespeare transfers the most perilous stuff in him to Macbeth.&nbsp;
The function smothered in surmise; the reflection on the emptiness of
life - tale told by an idiot - Shakespeare empties it into this murderous
traitor.&nbsp; He makes him the <i>prey</i> of that which is mixed in
the composition of the best.</p>
<p>The witches do not strike us as miraculous.&nbsp; They are not supernatural,
but extensions of the natural.</p>
<p>It is an apology for emendation that one of the most celebrated passages
in the play is based on conjecture (confirmed by what follows) and on
analogy.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;I dare do all that may become a man;<br />Who dares <i>no</i>
[Folio] more is none.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;No&rsquo; - corrected by Rowe to &lsquo;do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In <i>Measure for Measure</i> we have</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Be that you are,<br />That is, a woman;
if you be more, you&rsquo;re none.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Note the terrible, gasping brevity of the dialogue between Lady Macbeth
and her husband after the murder:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Lady M</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did not you speak?<br /><i>M</i>.&nbsp;
When?<br /><i>Lady M</i>.&nbsp; Now.<br /><i>M</i>.&nbsp; As I descended?<br /><i>Lady
M</i>.&nbsp; Ay.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Macbeth&rsquo;s speech beginning just before he hears of Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s
death, and ending after he hears of it, should be interpreted and spoken
as follows.&nbsp; He had just said he &lsquo;will laugh a siege to scorn.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then a cry of women within.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;What is that noise?<br /><i>Seyton</i>.&nbsp;
It is the cry of women, my good lord.<br /><i>[Exit.<br />Macbeth</i>
(musing).&nbsp; I have almost forgot the taste of fears.<br />The time
has been, my senses would have cool&rsquo;d<br />To hear a night-shriek;
and my fell of hair<br />Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir<br />As
life were in &rsquo;t: I have supp&rsquo;d full with horrors;<br />Direness,
familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,<br />Cannot once start me.</p>
<p><i>Re-enter Seyton.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore was that cry?<br /><i>Seyton</i>.&nbsp;
The queen, my lord, is dead.<br /><i>Macbeth</i> (with a touch of impatience).&nbsp;
She should have died hereafter:<br />There would have been a time for
such a word.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He makes no inquiry about his wife, but goes on with his reverie,
which does not specially refer to her.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br />Creeps in this
petty pace from day to day<br />To the last syllable of recorded time,<br />And
all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br />The way to dusty death.&nbsp;
Out, out, brief candle!<br />Life&rsquo;s but a walking shadow, a poor
player<br />That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br />And then
is heard no more: it is a tale<br />Told by an idiot, full of sound
and fury,<br />Signifying nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The &lsquo;<i>petty</i> pace,&rsquo; coming from Macbeth!&nbsp; The
&lsquo;out, out, brief candle,&rsquo; should be spoken in the same musing
tone.</p>
<p>Johnson says of a learned apology by Heath for a line in <i>Macbeth</i>
which is defective in metre: &lsquo;This is one of the effects of literature
in minds not naturally perspicacious&rsquo; - a criticism which might
be extended to much Shakespearean comment.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Cymbeline</i>. - The wager is loathsome.&nbsp; If any man with
whom we were acquainted had laid it, should we not scorn and brand him?&nbsp;
It was a crime to mention Imogen&rsquo;s name in such society as that
which met at Philario&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The only excuse is Boccaccio,
but what shall we say of Iachimo&rsquo;s interview with Imogen, invented
by Shakespeare!&nbsp; After his beastly experiment upon her, he excuses
himself:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;I have spoke this, to know if your affiance<br />Were deeply
rooted.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>She begs him to prolong his visit!&nbsp; The apology is worse than
the original insult.</p>
<p>The royal behaviour, or what Shakespeare means us to take for royal
behaviour, in the two youths is overdone and sometimes repulsive.</p>
<p>Arviragus goes out of his way to put his love for Imogen higher than
that for his supposed father, Belarius, who is present.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The bier at door,<br />And a demand who
is&rsquo;t shall die, I&rsquo;d say<br />My father, not this youth.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Yet the point of the scene is the nobility of blood in these youths!</p>
<p>Lucius, who had protected Imogen, hopes she will plead for his life,
and she turns on him:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;No, no; alack!<br />There&rsquo;s other
work in hand: I see a thing<br />Bitter to me as death: your life, good
master,<br />Must shuffle for itself.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the fifth act Posthumus believes his wife to be guilty, and yet
breaks out into strains like these:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;So I&rsquo;ll die,<br />For thee, O Imogen!
even for whom my life<br />Is every breath a death.<br />. . .<br />For
Imogen&rsquo;s dear life take mine; and though<br />&rsquo;Tis not so
dear, yet &rsquo;tis a life; you coin&rsquo;d it.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Shakespeare surely ought to have made Posthumus revert to perfect
faith.&nbsp; He ought to have borrowed something from his own Beatrice.&nbsp;
Posthumus wishes Imogen saved, because, if her life had been spared,
she might have repented.</p>
<p>Iachimo is impossible, simple blackness, worse than Iago.&nbsp; He
is unactable, for some motivation is necessary.</p>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius is so immense that it overpowers us, and
we must be on our guard lest it should twist our instinct for what is
true and right.&nbsp; The errors of a fool are not dangerous, but those
of a Shakespeare, Goethe, or Byron it is almost impossible to resist.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Twelfth Night</i>. - The play is two plays in one without much
connection.&nbsp; The Viola play is improbable.&nbsp; Why did Shakespeare
omit that part of the story which tells us that Silla (Viola) had seen
the Duke when he was shipwrecked on Cyprus where she lived, and had
fallen in love with him?&nbsp; In the play, hearing of the Duke, she
discloses a design to make her &lsquo;own occasion mellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malvolio shut up as mad -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Clown</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning
wild-fowl?</p>
<p><i>Malvolio</i>.&nbsp; That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit
a bird.</p>
<p><i>Clown</i>.&nbsp; What thinkest thou of his opinion?</p>
<p><i>Malvolio</i>.&nbsp; I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve
his opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Malvolio was a gentleman, but he was more.&nbsp; Shakespeare may
go a little too far with the yellow stockings and cross-gartering, but
the liability to deception by a supposed profession of love is a divine
weakness, not inconsistent with true nobility of intellect and with
sagacity.&nbsp; There is no reason to suppose he was often deceived
in worldly matters.&nbsp; Maria is a bad sort of clever barmaid, and
was not unwilling to marry the drunken Sir Toby.&nbsp; When I last saw
<i>Twelfth Night</i> acted, the whole of the latter part of the fifth
act was omitted, for the purpose, apparently, of strengthening the representation
of Malvolio as a comic fool whose silly brain is turned by conceit.&nbsp;
It was shocking, but the manager knew his audience.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>. - Casca is indignant that C&aelig;sar
should be offered the crown, but he despises the applause of the mob
when C&aelig;sar rejected it.&nbsp; &lsquo;The rabblement hooted and
clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and
uttered such a deal of stinking breath because C&aelig;sar refused the
crown that it had almost choked C&aelig;sar; for he swounded and fell
down at it; and for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening
my lips and receiving the bad air.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Brutus</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Between the acting of a dreadful thing<br />And
the first motion, all the interim is<br />Like a phantasma, or a hideous
dream:<br />The Genius and the mortal instruments<br />Are then in council;
and the state of man,<br />Like to a little kingdom, suffers then<br />The
nature of an insurrection.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I cannot think Dr. Johnson, Mason, and Delius are right in supposing
the Genius to be the power which watches over us for our protection,
and that the mortal instruments are the passions which rebel against
it, and, as Johnson says, &lsquo;excite him to a deed of honour and
danger.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Genius and the mortal instruments are in council.&nbsp;
The Genius is the president and the mortal instruments are subordinates.&nbsp;
The insurrection is their resistance because they cannot at once be
brought to do what the Genius directs.&nbsp; There is no hint in what
goes before of &lsquo;safety.&rsquo;&nbsp; The mortal instruments suggest</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;I know no personal cause to spurn at him.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Blakeway agrees with this interpretation.</p>
<p>In both Plutarch and Shakespeare, Brutus refuses to kill Antony.&nbsp;
Brutus will go no further than justice demands.&nbsp; But this is not
enough for success.&nbsp; Hence the ruin of the republican cause.</p>
<p>Steevens says that the apparition at Sardis &lsquo;could not be at
once the shade of C&aelig;sar and the evil genius of Brutus.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But Shakespeare intended that it should be both.&nbsp; Brutus in the
fifth scene of the fifth act thus replies to Volumnius:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;The ghost of C&aelig;sar hath appear&rsquo;d to me<br />Two
several times by night: at Sardis, once;<br />And, this last night,
here in Philippi&rsquo;s fields.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It is an instance of Steevens&rsquo; prosaic temper that he could
not see the fitness of the combination.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Brutus</i>.&nbsp; And whether we shall meet again I know not.<br />Therefore
our everlasting farewell take;<br />For ever, and for ever, farewell,
Cassius!<br />If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;<br />If not,
why then, this parting was well made.<br /><i>Cassius</i>.&nbsp; For
ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!<br />If we do meet again, we&rsquo;ll
smile indeed;<br />If not, &rsquo;tis true, this parting was well made.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>These verses are perhaps the noblest in our language.&nbsp; Nothing
ever has gone or could go beyond them.&nbsp; Shakespeare here justifies
the claim on his behalf to be placed alone and unreachable.&nbsp; Observe
the repetition by Cassius almost word for word.&nbsp; Swift must have
had this passage in his mind when in a letter to Pope, which I quote
from memory, as I cannot lay my hand on it, he tells Pope that he will
come over to England and see him if possible, but, if not, &lsquo;we
must part, as all human creatures have parted.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Why, then, lead on.&nbsp; O! that a man might know<br />The
end of this day&rsquo;s business ere it come!<br />But it sufficeth
that the day will end,<br />And then the end is known.&nbsp; Come, ho!
away!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>These lines might easily be turned into commonplace, but what could
be more pathetic or solemn?</p>
<p>The true drama of Julius C&aelig;sar is indicated by Plutarch.&nbsp;
It is C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s triumph over innumerable difficulties, any
one of which might have been fatal, the protection by his genius, the
limitation of its power, the Dictatorship - &lsquo;Semideus,&rsquo;
his death.&nbsp; Shakespeare gives no reason, nor does Plutarch, why
Brutus should have plotted to kill C&aelig;sar, excepting the fear of
what might happen if he were to become absolute.&nbsp; Brutus is abstract.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Such one he was (of him we boldly say),<br />In whose rich
soule all sovereigne powres did sute,<br />In whom in peace the elements
all lay<br />So mixt, as none could soveraigntie impute;<br />As all
did govern, yet all did obey;<br />His lively temper was so absolute,<br />That
&rsquo;t seem&rsquo;d, when heaven his modell first began,<br />In him
it show&rsquo;d perfection in a man.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This is Drayton&rsquo;s imitation of what Antony says of Brutus,
and it is one which not only does not spoil the original, but is itself
original.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>. - It is not Antony&rsquo;s passion for
Cleopatra which ruins him.&nbsp; He has not the cohesion which obtains
success.&nbsp; He is loose-bonded.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar is his complete
foil and contrast.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar exists dramatically to explain
Antony.&nbsp; Antony&rsquo;s challenge to single combat and the speeches
he makes to his servants are characteristic.&nbsp; The marriage to Octavia,
more than his Egyptian slavery, shows his weakness.&nbsp; There is a
line in Plutarch which I wish Shakespeare had used.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
it was in the nature of Antonius to show his best qualities in difficulties,
and in his misfortune he was as like as may be to a good man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scenes 6 and 7, Act ii., the interview with Pompey, are in Plutarch,
but it is not evident why they are in the drama.&nbsp; They do not advance
the action.&nbsp; Shakespeare preserves also Antony&rsquo;s message
to Octavius that if he was dissatisfied with the treatment of Thyreus
he might hang or torture Antony&rsquo;s freedman Hipparchus - a detestable
piece of brutality which might well have been omitted.</p>
<p>Cleopatra is quite apart from Shakespeare&rsquo;s other women.&nbsp;
She is a most complicated and difficult study.&nbsp; Shakespeare takes
over from Plutarch her wandering disguised through the streets at night
with Antony; the voyage down the Cydnus; the hanging of the salt fish
on Antony&rsquo;s hook; the flight at Actium; the fact that she was
mistress of Julius C&aelig;sar and Cn&aelig;us Pompey; the second betrayal
of the fleet; her petition to Octavius for her son; and her attempt
to cheat Octavius in the account of her treasures.&nbsp; In addition
Shakespeare makes her &lsquo;hop forty paces through the public street.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What could have induced him to invent this story?&nbsp; She threatens
Charmian with bloody teeth; lets Thyreus kiss her hand, arousing thereby
Antony&rsquo;s rage.&nbsp; Thyreus tells her that C&aelig;sar knows
she did not embrace Antony from love but from fear, and she replies:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;He is a god, and knows<br />What is most
right: mine honour was not yielded,<br />But conquer&rsquo;d merely.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This may be mockery, but after she has let Thyreus kiss her she goes
on:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Your C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s father oft,<br />When
he hath mus&rsquo;d of taking kingdoms in,<br />Bestow&rsquo;d his lips
on that unworthy place,<br />As it rain&rsquo;d kisses.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>She reminds herself of this, fresh from Antony, who had just told
her of Octavius&rsquo;s offer to protect her if she would give up the
&lsquo;grizled head&rsquo; of her lover.</p>
<p>After Antony&rsquo;s death she finds</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;nothing left remarkable<br />Beneath the
visiting moon.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>She tells Proculeius before he surprises her that she would gladly
look C&aelig;sar in the face, but she tries to stab herself, for,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Know, sir, that I<br />Will not wait pinion&rsquo;d
at your master&rsquo;s court;<br />Nor once be chastis&rsquo;d with
the sober eye<br />Of dull Octavia.&nbsp; Shall they hoist me up<br />And
show me to the shouting varletry<br />Of censuring Rome?&nbsp; Rather
a ditch in Egypt<br />Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus&rsquo;
mud<br />Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies<br />Blow me into
abhorring! rather make<br />My country&rsquo;s high pyramides my gibbet,<br />And
hang me up in chains!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>She asks Dolabella what C&aelig;sar means to do with her, and when
she learns that she is to be taken to Rome she recurs to the horror
of the triumph.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Now, Iras, what think&rsquo;st thou?<br />Thou,
an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown<br />In Rome, as well as I: mechanick
slaves<br />With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall<br />Uplift
us to the view; in their thick breaths,<br />Rank of gross diet, shall
we be enclouded,<br />And forced to drink their vapour.<br /><i>Iras</i>.&nbsp;
The gods forbid!<br /><i>Cleopatra</i>.&nbsp; Nay, &rsquo;tis most certain,
Iras: saucy lictors<br />Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald
rhymers<br />Ballad us out o&rsquo; tune; the quick comedians,<br />Extemporally
will stage us, and present<br />Our Alexandrian revels; Antony<br />Shall
be brought drunken forth, and I shall see<br />Some squeaking Cleopatra
boy my greatness<br />I&rsquo; the posture of a whore.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This was a motive for death, but it was not all.&nbsp; She reproves
herself because she let Iras die first, because Antony will</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;make demand of her, and spend that kiss<br />Which
is my heaven to have&rsquo;;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and Antony is her last word.</p>
<p>Charmian declares her to be &lsquo;a lass unparallel&rsquo;d,&rsquo;
of &lsquo;royal eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to shut this woman up within the limits of what
we call a character, but why should we attempt it?&nbsp; Why cannot
we be content with what we have before us?&nbsp; Shakespeare never defined
his people to himself.&nbsp; In Cleopatra we have a new combination
of the simple, eternal elements, a combination subtle, and beyond analysis.&nbsp;
What celestial lights begin to play over this passion as the drama goes
on!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Coriolanus</i>. - We cannot help being sorry that Shakespeare
should have gone out of his way to select such a subject.&nbsp; It leaves
a disagreeable taste in the mouth.&nbsp; The aristocrat is overdone.&nbsp;
No true aristocrat would talk such rant as Coriolanus talks in Act i.
Sc. I.&nbsp; Shakespeare omits Plutarch&rsquo;s account of the oppression
of the plebeians, or only slightly alludes to it.&nbsp; Volumnia&rsquo;s
contempt for the people is worse than that of Coriolanus.&nbsp; To her
they are not human, and she does not consider that common truthfulness
is binding in her intercourse with them.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;It lies you on to speak<br />To the people,
not by your own instruction,<br />Nor by the matter which your heart
prompts you,<br />But with such words that are but rooted in<br />Your
tongue, though but bastards and syllables<br />Of no allowance to your
bosom&rsquo;s truth.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Reading such passages as these we understand Whitman when he says
that although Shakespeare is &lsquo;of astral genius,&rsquo; he is &lsquo;entirely
fit for feudalism . . . is incarnated, uncompromising feudalism,&rsquo;
and contains much which is &lsquo;ever offensive to democracy.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>. - Coleridge is perhaps super-subtle in
his discrimination between the jealousy of Leontes and that of Othello,
which Coleridge will not call jealousy.&nbsp; But the difference is
not greater than that between the two men.&nbsp; The passion of Leontes
is roused simply by Hermione&rsquo;s giving her hand to Polixenes.&nbsp;
This common courtesy is &lsquo;paddling palms.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is
something contemptible in his transports: not so in the case of Othello.&nbsp;
Leontes cursing Hermione in the presence of his lords is unendurable.</p>
<p>Leontes in his passion disbelieves the oracle.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;There is no truth at all i&rsquo; the oracle:<br />The
sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But he is reversed, suddenly, completely, when he is told his son
is dead.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Apollo&rsquo;s angry; and the heavens themselves<br />Do strike
at my injustice.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Perdita is brought up by a shepherd and talks like a well-educated
patrician&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Proserpina,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp;
Polixenes says to Camillo:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever<br />Ran on
the green-sward: nothing she does or seems<br />But smacks of something
greater than herself,<br />Too noble for this place.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Here again the emphasis on descent is exaggerated and we resent it.</p>
<p>Leontes after the statue is unveiled -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;But yet, Paulina,<br />Hermione was not
so much wrinkled, nothing<br />So aged as this seems.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Who can read this without choking?&nbsp; Like Exeter in <i>Henry
V</i>.:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I had not so much of man in me,<br />And
all my mother came into mine eyes,<br />And gave me up to tears.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Could I have continued to live when that music sounded and she descended?&nbsp;
I think not.&nbsp; I should have sought pardon and death.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Now, in age,<br />Is she become the suitor?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Who can - I will not say express, but dream a tenderness deeper than
that?&nbsp; Sixteen years she had waited, and then she embraces him!&nbsp;
It is difficult to divine Shakespeare, the man, in his plays and poems,
but in this passage and one or two others resembling it he seems to
be revealed.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Pericles</i>. - The last act of Pericles, and especially the first
scene, is Shakespeare at his highest.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;O Helicanus, strike me, honour&rsquo;d sir;<br />Give me a
gash, put me to present pain;<br />Lest this great sea of joys rushing
upon me,<br />O&rsquo;erbear the shores of my mortality,<br />And drown
me with their sweetness.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What can equal in purifying, regenerative power the fact that one
human being can be so much to another?&nbsp; No theology, morality,
or philosophy can bring a man so near to God.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Tempest</i>. - Prospero&rsquo;s pardon for those who had conspired
against him proceeds from &lsquo;our little life is rounded with a sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Tempest</i> is called a comedy, but it suggests a tragedy
in Prospero&rsquo;s return to Milan and the months or years he spent
there till he died.&nbsp; For twelve years he had been on the island
with Miranda, &lsquo;a thrid of his own life,&rsquo; &lsquo;that for
which he lived,&rsquo; &lsquo;the cherubin that did preserve him&rsquo;
during his voyage, who raised in him</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;An undergoing stomach, to bear up<br />Against what should
ensue.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He hears her, smitten with Ferdinand almost in a moment, declare
to him:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I would not wish<br />Any companion in the
world but you,<br />Nor can imagination form a shape,<br />Besides yourself,
to like of&rsquo;;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and she leaves her father and goes far away to Naples with her husband.</p>
<p>Ariel, whom Prospero had freed from his miserable enchantment, had
never ceased to thirst for liberty and returns to the winds.&nbsp; Dearly
had Prospero loved his delicate Ariel.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s my dainty Ariel!&nbsp; I shall miss thee;<br />But
yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Caliban he had tried to reclaim, had taught him speech and to name
the big and lesser light, but all his pains were &lsquo;lost, quite
lost,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;born devil&rsquo; rewarded them by an attempt
on Miranda&rsquo;s chastity.&nbsp; He is left behind, master of the
island again, to take up his abode in the cell which Prospero and Miranda
had inhabited, and with the added experience of Stephano&rsquo;s drink,
which he probably soon learned to imitate.</p>
<p>Antonio, the usurping brother, is said to have been penitent, but
his penitence was not profound.&nbsp; He offered no apology, and the
first words he is recorded to have uttered after his guilt was discovered
were a joke upon &lsquo;the plain fish,&rsquo; Caliban.&nbsp; He was
forgiven, and most likely once more became malignant.</p>
<p>There is nothing to show us that the citizens of Milan were in much
trouble when Prospero was deposed, or that they rejoiced when he was
restored.&nbsp; They, doubtless, regretted Antonio, who</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Set all hearts i&rsquo; the state<br />To
what tune pleased his ear.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The lord of the spirits, of the elves who chased the ebbing Neptune,
he who had given fire to the dread rattling thunder, broke his staff
and drowned his book and went back to his lonely palace.&nbsp; Did he
never long for his island, for Ariel&rsquo;s music, for his daughter&rsquo;s
daily presence, replaced by infrequent letters with news of the Court,
her children, and Ferdinand?&nbsp; He may have reflected that she was
happy, but nevertheless every third thought was his grave.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Merchant of Venice</i>. - Jessica is hateful from the beginning;
the disguise in boy&rsquo;s clothes, the robbery of her father, and
the exchange for a monkey of the jewel which belonged to her mother.&nbsp;
I am afraid Shakespeare intended we should like her.&nbsp; But she is
only a part of the perplexity of the play.&nbsp; That Shakespeare should
have used the casket story is inexplicable.&nbsp; Not only is it, as
Johnson says, &lsquo;wildly improbable,&rsquo; it confuses Portia&rsquo;s
character: it is an irritating absurdity.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;But more, for that in low simplicity<br />He lends out money
gratis.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We have no proof that Antonio did this.&nbsp; He may have done it.&nbsp;
He was the kind of person who might like popularity.&nbsp; If he was
really guilty of &lsquo;low simplicity,&rsquo; I sympathise with Shylock&rsquo;s
hatred of him.&nbsp; But if he was not, I understand it.&nbsp; Shylock
was not bound to be generous.&nbsp; It would have been ridiculous in
him, an alien in blood and religion, persecuted, spat upon.</p>
<p>The interest of the play departs with Shylock.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays are organic, one character cannot be understood
without the other; Hamlet without Ophelia; Romeo without Juliet.&nbsp;
Each is in, by, and of the other; particularised by the other.&nbsp;
I do not find this quality, at least in anything like the same degree,
in Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>
<p>Note the way in which Shakespeare&rsquo;s characters - Macbeth, for
example - unfold themselves by new circumstances, what unconjecturable
development takes place.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>When a serious defect presents itself in a living friend it seems
to obtrude itself, press upon us, and affect our judgment more than
if we see it in a play of Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the play the
background of counterbalancing virtue is not obscured and forgotten.&nbsp;
In actual life we lose sight of it.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>FINIS</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;He that considers how little he dwells upon the condition
of others will learn how little the attention of others is attracted
by himself.&nbsp; While we see multitudes passing before us, of whom
perhaps not one appears to deserve our notice, or excite our sympathy,
we should remember that we likewise are lost in the same throng; that
the eye which happens to glance upon us is turned in a moment on him
that follows us, and that the utmost which we can reasonably hope or
fear, is to fill a vacant hour with prattle, and be forgotten.&rsquo;

<p><a name="footnote148"></a><a href="#citation148">{148}</a>&nbsp;
On the 24th April 1885 a fire broke out in an oil-monger&rsquo;s house
in the Borough.&nbsp; The inmates were the oil-monger, his wife, four
children, and Alice, the servant-of-all-work.&nbsp; She came to the
window as soon as the alarm was raised and shouted for help.&nbsp; Before
the fire brigade arrived the whole building was in flames.&nbsp; The
people in the street called to her to jump and held out clothes to break
her fall, but she went back and presently reappeared dragging a feather
bed with her, which she pushed out.&nbsp; It was instantly extended
below, and Alice fetched one of the children and threw it most carefully
down.&nbsp; It was saved, and two other children also were saved by
her in the same way.&nbsp; By this time it was evident that the suffocating
fumes were beginning to affect her, for her aim with the last two was
not steady.&nbsp; The crowd implored her to leap, but it was too late.&nbsp;
She could not make a proper spring and fell on the ground.&nbsp; Five
minutes afterwards the engines and fire-escape appeared.&nbsp; She was
picked up and died in Guy&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; I begged her portrait
from her brother.&nbsp; It is not remarkable.&nbsp; That, perhaps, is
the best thing that can be said about it.&nbsp; It is a pleasant, brave
face - a face that you might see a dozen times on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
